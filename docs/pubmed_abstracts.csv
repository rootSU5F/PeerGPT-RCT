https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37459086,"Importance:Fewer than 5% of patients labeled with a penicillin allergy are truly allergic. The standard of care to remove the penicillin allergy label in adults is specialized testing involving prick and intradermal skin testing followed by an oral challenge with penicillin. Skin testing is resource intensive, limits practice to specialist-trained physicians, and restricts the global population who could undergo penicillin allergy delabeling.Objective:To determine whether a direct oral penicillin challenge is noninferior to the standard of care of penicillin skin testing followed by an oral challenge in patients with a low-risk penicillin allergy.Design, setting, and participants:This parallel, 2-arm, noninferiority, open-label, multicenter, international randomized clinical trial occurred in 6 specialized centers, 3 in North America (US and Canada) and 3 in Australia, from June 18, 2021, to December 2, 2022. Eligible adults had a PEN-FAST score lower than 3. PEN-FAST is a prospectively derived and internationally validated clinical decision rule that enables point-of-care risk assessment for adults reporting penicillin allergies.Interventions:Patients were randomly assigned to either direct oral challenge with penicillin (intervention arm) or a standard-of-care arm of penicillin skin testing followed by oral challenge with penicillin (control arm).Main outcome and measure:The primary outcome was a physician-verified positive immune-mediated oral penicillin challenge within 1 hour postintervention in the intention-to-treat population. Noninferiority was achieved if a 1-sided 95% CI of the risk difference (RD) did not exceed 5 percentage points (pp).Results:A total of 382 adults were randomized, with 377 patients (median [IQR] age, 51 [35-65] years; 247 [65.5%] female) included in the analysis: 187 in the intervention group and 190 in the control group. Most patients had a PEN-FAST score of 0 or 1. The primary outcome occurred in 1 patient (0.5%) in the intervention group and 1 patient (0.5%) in the control group, with an RD of 0.0084 pp (90% CI, -1.22 to 1.24 pp). The 1-sided 95% CI was below the noninferiority margin of 5 pp. In the 5 days following the oral penicillin challenge, 9 immune-mediated adverse events were recorded in the intervention group and 10 in the control group (RD, -0.45 pp; 95% CI, -4.87 to 3.96 pp). No serious adverse events occurred.Conclusions and relevance:In this randomized clinical trial, direct oral penicillin challenge in patients with a low-risk penicillin allergy was noninferior compared with standard-of-care skin testing followed by oral challenge. In patients with a low-risk history, direct oral penicillin challenge is a safe procedure to facilitate the removal of a penicillin allergy label.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT04454229."

Standardized assessments of quality-checked video and audio recordings at 1, 3, and 5 years of age were performed independently by speech and language therapists who were unaware of the trial-group assignments. The primary outcome was velopharyngeal insufficiency at 5 years of age, defined as a velopharyngeal composite summary score of at least 4 (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater severity). Secondary outcomes included speech development, postoperative complications, hearing sensitivity, dentofacial development, and growth.Results:We randomly assigned 558 infants at 23 centers across Europe and South America to undergo surgery at 6 months of age (281 infants) or at 12 months of age (277 infants). Speech recordings from 235 infants (83.6%) in the 6-month group and 226 (81.6%) in the 12-month group were analyzable. Insufficient velopharyngeal function at 5 years of age was observed in 21 of 235 infants (8.9%) in the 6-month group as compared with 34 of 226 (15.0%) in the 12-month group (risk ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.99; P = 0.04). Postoperative complications were infrequent and similar in the 6-month and 12-month groups. Four serious adverse events were reported (three in the 6-month group and one in the 12-month group) and had resolved at follow-up.Conclusions:Medically fit infants who underwent primary surgery for isolated cleft palate in adequately resourced settings at 6 months of age were less likely to have velopharyngeal insufficiency at the age of 5 years than those who had surgery at 12 months of age.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37646676,"Background:Concizumab is an anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor monoclonal antibody designed to achieve hemostasis in all hemophilia types, with subcutaneous administration. A previous trial of concizumab (explorer4) established proof of concept in patients with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors.Methods:We conducted the explorer7 trial to assess the safety and efficacy of concizumab in patients with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio to receive no prophylaxis for at least 24 weeks (group 1) or concizumab prophylaxis for at least 32 weeks (group 2) or were nonrandomly assigned to receive concizumab prophylaxis for at least 24 weeks (groups 3 and 4). After a treatment pause due to nonfatal thromboembolic events in three patients receiving concizumab, including one from the explorer7 trial, concizumab therapy was restarted with a loading dose of 1.0 mg per kilogram of body weight, followed by 0.2 mg per kilogram daily (potentially adjusted on the basis of concizumab plasma concentration as measured at week 4). The primary end-point analysis compared treated spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes in group 1 and group 2. Safety, patient-reported outcomes, and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were also assessed.Results:Of 133 enrolled patients, 19 were randomly assigned to group 1 and 33 to group 2; the remaining 81 were assigned to groups 3 and 4. The estimated mean annualized bleeding rate in group 1 was 11.8 episodes (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.0 to 19.9), as compared with 1.7 episodes (95% CI, 1.0 to 2.9) in group 2 (rate ratio, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.07 to 0.29]; P<0.001). The overall median annualized bleeding rate for patients receiving concizumab (groups 2, 3, and 4) was 0 episodes. No thromboembolic events were reported after concizumab therapy was restarted. The plasma concentrations of concizumab remained stable over time.Conclusions:Among patients with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors, the annualized bleeding rate was lower with concizumab prophylaxis than with no prophylaxis.

Up to 50 therapy sessions were provided over 12 months. The control group received usual care plus a falls risk assessment. Procedures were adapted during the covid-19 pandemic.Main outcome measures:The primary outcome was score on the carer (informant) reported disability assessment for dementia scale 12 months after randomisation. Secondary outcomes were self-reported activities of daily living, physical activity, quality of life, balance, functional mobility, fear of falling, frailty, cognition, mood, carer strain, service use at 12 months, and falls between months 4 and 15.Results:365 patient participants were randomised, 183 to intervention and 182 to control. The median age of participants was 80 years (range 65-95), median Montreal cognitive assessment score was 20 out of 30 (range 13-26), and 58% (n=210) were men. Intervention participants received a median of 31 therapy sessions (interquartile range 22-40) and reported completing a mean 121 minutes of PrAISED exercise each week. Primary outcome data were available for 149 intervention and 141 control participants. Scores on the disability assessment for dementia scale did not differ between groups: adjusted mean difference -1.3, 95% confidence interval -5.2 to 2.6; Cohen's d effect size -0.06, 95% confidence interval -0.26 to 0.15; P=0.51). Upper 95% confidence intervals excluded small to moderate effects on any of the range of outcome measures. Between months 4 and 15 the intervention group experienced 79 falls and the control group 200 falls (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.3; P=0.3).Conclusion:The intensive PrAISED programme of exercise and functional activity training did not improve activities of daily living, physical activity, or quality of life; reduce falls; or improve any other secondary health status outcomes, despite good uptake. Future research should consider alternative approaches to maintaining ability and wellbeing in people with dementia.Trial registration:ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN15320670."

The control group did not receive any of the interventions.Main outcome measure:Difference between the two groups in change in salt intake measured by 24 hour urinary sodium during the 12 month follow-up.Results:1576 participants (775 (49.2%) men; mean age 55.8 (standard deviation 10.8) years) from 788 families (one home cook and one other adult in each family) completed the baseline assessment. After baseline assessment, 30 communities with 786 participants were allocated to the intervention group and 30 communities with 790 participants to the control group. During the trial, 157 (10%) participants were lost to follow-up, and the remaining 706 participants in the intervention group and 713 participants in the control group completed the follow-up assessment. During the 12 month follow-up, the urinary sodium excretion decreased from 4368.7 (standard deviation 1880.3) mg per 24 hours to 3977.0 (1688.8) mg per 24 hours in the intervention group and from 4418.7 (1973.7) mg per 24 hours to 4330.9 (1859.8) mg per 24 hours in the control group. Compared with the control group, adjusted mixed linear model analysis showed that the 24 hour urinary sodium excretion in the intervention group was reduced by 336.8 (95% confidence interval 127.9 to 545.7) mg per 24 hours (P=0.002); the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced by 2.0 (0.4 to 3.5) (P=0.01) and 1.1 (0.1 to 2.0) mm Hg (P=0.03), respectively; and the knowledge, attitude, and behaviours in the intervention group improved significantly.Conclusions:The community based salt reduction package targeting home cooks and family members was effective in lowering salt intake and blood pressure. This intervention has the potential to be widely applied in China and other countries where home cooking remains a major source of salt intake.Trial registration:Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR1800016804."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37606673,"Importance:Whether protein risk scores derived from a single plasma sample could be useful for risk assessment for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), in conjunction with clinical risk factors and polygenic risk scores, is uncertain.Objective:To develop protein risk scores for ASCVD risk prediction and compare them to clinical risk factors and polygenic risk scores in primary and secondary event populations.Design, setting, and participants:The primary analysis was a retrospective study of primary events among 13 540 individuals in Iceland (aged 40-75 years) with proteomics data and no history of major ASCVD events at recruitment (study duration, August 23, 2000 until October 26, 2006; follow-up through 2018). We also analyzed a secondary event population from a randomized, double-blind lipid-lowering clinical trial (2013-2016), consisting of individuals with stable ASCVD receiving statin therapy and for whom proteomic data were available for 6791 individuals.Exposures:Protein risk scores (based on 4963 plasma protein levels and developed in a training set in the primary event population); polygenic risk scores for coronary artery disease and stroke; and clinical risk factors that included age, sex, statin use, hypertension treatment, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, and smoking status at the time of plasma sampling.Main outcomes and measures:Outcomes were composites of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary heart disease death or cardiovascular death. Performance was evaluated using Cox survival models and measures of discrimination and reclassification that accounted for the competing risk of non-ASCVD death.Results:In the primary event population test set (4018 individuals [59.0% women]; 465 events; median follow-up, 15.8 years), the protein risk score had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.93 per SD (95% CI, 1.75 to 2.13). Addition of protein risk score and polygenic risk scores significantly increased the C index when added to a clinical risk factor model (C index change, 0.022 [95% CI, 0.007 to 0.038]). Addition of the protein risk score alone to a clinical risk factor model also led to a significantly increased C index (difference, 0.014 [95% CI, 0.002 to 0.028]). Among White individuals in the secondary event population (6307 participants; 432 events; median follow-up, 2.2 years), the protein risk score had an HR of 1.62 per SD (95% CI, 1.48 to 1.79) and significantly increased C index when added to a clinical risk factor model (C index change, 0.026 [95% CI, 0.011 to 0.042]). The protein risk score was significantly associated with major adverse cardiovascular events among individuals of African and Asian ancestries in the secondary event population.Conclusions and relevance:A protein risk score was significantly associated with ASCVD events in primary and secondary event populations. When added to clinical risk factors, the protein risk score and polygenic risk score both provided statistically significant but modest improvement in discrimination."

A total of 324 patients with ICA or MCA occlusion with transient ischemic attack or nondisabling ischemic stroke attributed to hemodynamic insufficiency based on computed tomography perfusion imaging were recruited between June 2013 and March 2018 (final follow-up: March 18, 2020).Interventions:EC-IC bypass surgery plus medical therapy (surgical group; n = 161) or medical therapy alone (medical group; n = 163). Medical therapy included antiplatelet therapy and stroke risk factor control.Main outcomes and measures:The primary outcome was a composite of stroke or death within 30 days or ipsilateral ischemic stroke beyond 30 days through 2 years after randomization. There were 9 secondary outcomes, including any stroke or death within 2 years and fatal stroke within 2 years.Results:Among 330 patients who were enrolled, 324 patients were confirmed eligible (median age, 52.7 years; 257 men [79.3%]) and 309 (95.4%) completed the trial.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37581673,"Importance:Surgical repairs of apical/uterovaginal prolapse are commonly performed using native tissue pelvic ligaments as the point of attachment for the vaginal cuff after a hysterectomy. Clinicians may recommend vaginal estrogen in an effort to reduce prolapse recurrence, but the effects of intravaginal estrogen on surgical prolapse management are uncertain.Objective:To compare the efficacy of perioperative vaginal estrogen vs placebo cream on prolapse recurrence following native tissue surgical prolapse repair.Design, setting, and participants:This randomized superiority clinical trial was conducted at 3 tertiary US clinical sites (Texas, Alabama, Rhode Island). Postmenopausal women (N = 206) with bothersome anterior and apical vaginal prolapse interested in surgical repair were enrolled in urogynecology clinics between December 2016 and February 2020.Interventions:The intervention was 1 g of conjugated estrogen cream (0.625 mg/g) or placebo, inserted vaginally nightly for 2 weeks and then twice weekly to complete at least 5 weeks of application preoperatively; this continued twice weekly for 12 months postoperatively. Participants underwent a vaginal hysterectomy (if uterus present) and standardized apical fixation (either uterosacral or sacrospinous ligament fixation).Main outcomes and measures:The primary outcome was time to failure of prolapse repair by 12 months after surgery defined by at least 1 of the following 3 outcomes: anatomical/objective prolapse of the anterior or posterior walls beyond the hymen or the apex descending more than one-third of the vaginal length, subjective vaginal bulge symptoms, or repeated prolapse treatment. Secondary outcomes included measures of urinary and sexual function, symptoms and signs of urogenital atrophy, and adverse events.Results:Of 206 postmenopausal women, 199 were randomized and 186 underwent surgery. The mean (SD) age of participants was 65 (6.7) years. The primary outcome was not significantly different for women receiving vaginal estrogen vs placebo through 12 months: 12-month failure incidence of 19% (n = 20) for vaginal estrogen vs 9% (n = 10) for placebo (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.97 [95% CI, 0.92-4.22]), with the anatomic recurrence component being most common, rather than vaginal bulge symptoms or prolapse repeated treatment. Masked surgeon assessment of vaginal tissue quality and estrogenization was significantly better in the vaginal estrogen group at the time of the operation. In the subset of participants with at least moderately bothersome vaginal atrophy symptoms at baseline (n = 109), the vaginal atrophy score for most bothersome symptom was significantly better at 12 months with vaginal estrogen.Conclusions and relevance:Adjunctive perioperative vaginal estrogen application did not improve surgical success rates after native tissue transvaginal prolapse repair.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT02431897."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37581672,"Importance:Intravenous magnesium sulfate administered to pregnant individuals before birth at less than 30 weeks' gestation reduces the risk of death and cerebral palsy in their children. The effects at later gestational ages are unclear.Objective:To determine whether administration of magnesium sulfate at 30 to 34 weeks' gestation reduces death or cerebral palsy at 2 years.Design, setting, and participants:This randomized clinical trial enrolled pregnant individuals expected to deliver at 30 to 34 weeks' gestation and was conducted at 24 Australian and New Zealand hospitals between January 2012 and April 2018.Intervention:Intravenous magnesium sulfate (4 g) was compared with placebo.Main outcomes and measures:The primary outcome was death (stillbirth, death of a live-born infant before hospital discharge, or death after hospital discharge before 2 years' corrected age) or cerebral palsy (loss of motor function and abnormalities of muscle tone and power assessed by a pediatrician) at 2 years' corrected age. There were 36 secondary outcomes that assessed the health of the pregnant individual, infant, and child.Results:Of the 1433 pregnant individuals enrolled (mean age, 30.6 [SD, 6.6] years; 46 [3.2%] self-identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, 237 [16.5%] as Asian, 82 [5.7%] as Māori, 61 [4.3%] as Pacific, and 966 [67.4%] as White) and their 1679 infants, 1365 (81%) offspring (691 in the magnesium group and 674 in the placebo group) were included in the primary outcome analysis. Death or cerebral palsy at 2 years' corrected age was not significantly different between the magnesium and placebo groups (3.3% [23 of 691 children] vs 2.7% [18 of 674 children], respectively; risk difference, 0.61% [95% CI, -1.27% to 2.50%]; adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.19 [95% CI, 0.65 to 2.18]).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37567200,"Background:In India, tuberculosis and undernutrition are syndemics with a high burden of tuberculosis coexisting with a high burden of undernutrition in patients and in the population. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of nutritional supplementation on tuberculosis incidence in household contacts of adults with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis.Methods:In this field-based, open-label, cluster-randomised controlled trial, we enrolled household contacts of 2800 patients with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis across 28 tuberculosis units of the National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme in four districts of Jharkhand, India. The tuberculosis units were randomly allocated 1:1 by block randomisation to the control group or the intervention group, by a statistician using computer-generated random numbers. Although microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis patients in both groups received food rations (1200 kcal, 52 grams of protein per day with micronutrients) for 6 months, only household contacts in the intervention group received monthly food rations and micronutrients (750 kcal, 23 grams of protein per day with micronutrients). After screening all household contacts for co-prevalent tuberculosis at baseline, all participants were followed up actively until July 31, 2022, for the primary outcome of incident tuberculosis (all forms). The ascertainment of the outcome was by independent medical staff in health services. We used Cox proportional hazards model and Poisson regression via the generalised estimating equation approach to estimate unadjusted hazard ratios, adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs), and incidence rate ratios (IRRs). This study is registered with CTRI-India, CTRI/2019/08/020490.Findings:Between Aug 16, 2019, and Jan 31, 2021, there were 10 345 household contacts, of whom 5328 (94·8%) of 5621 household contacts in the intervention group and 4283 (90·7%) of 4724 household contacts in the control group completed the primary outcome assessment. Almost two-thirds of the population belonged to Indigenous communities (eg, Santhals, Ho, Munda, Oraon, and Bhumij) and 34% (3543 of 10 345) had undernutrition. We detected 31 (0·3%) of 10 345 household contact patients with co-prevalent tuberculosis disease in both groups at baseline and 218 (2·1%) people were diagnosed with incident tuberculosis (all forms) over 21 869 person-years of follow-up, with 122 of 218 incident cases in the control group (2·6% [122 of 4712 contacts at risk], 95% CI 2·2-3·1; incidence rate 1·27 per 100 person-years) and 96 incident cases in the intervention group (1·7% [96 of 5602], 1·4-2·1; 0·78 per 100 person-years), of whom 152 (69·7%) of 218 were patients with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Tuberculosis incidence (all forms) in the intervention group had an adjusted IRR of 0·61 (95% CI 0·43-0·85; aHR 0·59 [0·42-0·83]), with an even greater decline in incidence of microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (0·52 [0·35-0·79]; 0·51 [0·34-0·78]). This translates into a relative reduction of tuberculosis incidence of 39% (all forms) to 48% (microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis) in the intervention group. An estimated 30 households (111 household contacts) would need to be provided nutritional supplementation to prevent one incident tuberculosis.Interpretation:To our knowledge, this is the first randomised trial looking at the effect of nutritional support on tuberculosis incidence in household contacts, whereby the nutritional intervention was associated with substantial (39-48%) reduction in tuberculosis incidence in the household during 2 years of follow-up. This biosocial intervention can accelerate reduction in tuberculosis incidence in countries or communities with a tuberculosis and undernutrition syndemic.Funding:Indian Council of Medical Research-India TB Research Consortium."

In this case, manufacturers were required to perform a randomized controlled trial in patients with asthma but not COPD, although the product received approval for both indications.Objective:To compare the effectiveness and safety of generic (Wixela Inhub) and brand-name (Advair Diskus) fluticasone-salmeterol among patients with COPD treated in routine care.Design:A 1:1 propensity score-matched cohort study.Setting:A large, longitudinal health care database.Patients:Adults older than 40 years with a diagnosis of COPD.Measurements:Incidence of first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation (effectiveness outcome) and incidence of first pneumonia hospitalization (safety outcome) in the 365 days after cohort entry.Results:Among 45 369 patients (27 305 Advair Diskus users and 18 064 Wixela Inhub users), 10 012 matched pairs were identified for the primary analysis. Compared with Advair Diskus use, Wixela Inhub use was associated with a nearly identical incidence of first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation (hazard ratio [HR], 0.97 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.04]) and first pneumonia hospitalization (HR, 0.99 [CI, 0.86 to 1.15]).Limitations:Follow-up times were short, reflecting real-world clinical practice. The possibility of residual confounding cannot be completely excluded.Conclusion:Use of generic and brand-name fluticasone-salmeterol was associated with similar outcomes among patients with COPD treated in routine practice.Primary funding source:National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37524101,"Background:Anaemia and blood transfusion are associated with poor outcomes after hip fracture. We evaluated the efficacy of intravenous iron and tranexamic acid in reducing blood transfusions after hip fracture surgery.Methods:In this double-blind, randomised, 2 × 2 factorial trial, we recruited adults hospitalised for hip fractures in 12 medical centres in France who had preoperative haemoglobin concentrations between 9·5 and 13·0 g/dL. We randomly allocated participants (1:1:1:1), via a secure web-based service, to ferric derisomaltose (20 mg/kg intravenously) and tranexamic acid (1 g bolus followed by 1 g over 8 h intravenously at inclusion and 3 g topically during surgery), iron plus placebo (normal saline), tranexamic acid plus placebo, or double placebo. Unmasked nurses administered study drugs; participants and other clinical and research staff remained masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients transfused during hospitalisation (or by day 30). The primary analysis included all randomised patients. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02972294) and is closed to new participants.Findings:Of 413 patients (51-104 years old, median [IQR] 86 [78-91], 312 [76%] women, 101 [24%] men), 104 received iron plus tranexamic acid, 103 iron plus placebo, 103 tranexamic acid plus placebo, and 103 double placebo between March 31, 2017 and June 18, 2021 (study stopped early for efficacy after the planned interim analysis done on the first 390 patients included on May 25, 2021). Data for the primary outcome were available for all participants. Among patients on double placebo, 31 (30%) were transfused versus 16 (15%) on both drugs (relative risk 0·51 [98·3% CI 0·27-0·97]; p=0·012). 27 (26%) participants on iron (0·81 [0·50-1·29]; p=0·28) and 28 (27%) on tranexamic acid (0·85 [0·54-1·33]; p=0·39) were transfused. 487 adverse events were reported with similar event rates among the groups; among prespecified safety endpoints, severe postoperative anaemia (haemoglobin <8 g/dL) was more frequent in the double placebo group. Main common adverse event were sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary infection, with similar rates among all groups.Interpretation:In patients hospitalised for hip fracture surgery with a haemoglobin concentration 9·5-13·0 g/dL, preoperative infusion of ferric derisomaltose plus tranexamic acid reduced the risk of blood transfusion by 50%. Our results suggest that combining treatments from two different pillars improves patient blood-management programmes. Either treatment alone did not reduce transfusion rates, but we might not have had the power to detect it.Funding:French Ministry of Health, HiFIT trial."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37516125,"Background:In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of atogepant for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine.Methods:We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 142 clinical research sites across the USA, the UK, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and Taiwan. Adults aged 18-80 years with a 1-year or longer history of chronic migraine were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive oral atogepant 30 mg twice a day, oral atogepant 60 mg once a day, or placebo. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days (MMDs) across the 12-week treatment period. The primary analysis was done in the modified intent-to-treat population and included all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study intervention, had an evaluable baseline period of electronic diary (eDiary) data, and had at least one evaluable post-baseline 4-week period (weeks 1-4, 5-8, and 9-12) of eDiary data during the double-blind period. The safety population consisted of all participants who received at least one dose of study intervention. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03855137).Findings:Between March 11, 2019 and Jan 20, 2022, 1489 participants were assessed for eligibility. 711 were excluded, and 778 participants were randomly assigned to atogepant 30 mg twice a day (n=257), atogepant 60 mg once a day (n=262), or placebo (n=259). Participants in the safety population were aged 18-74 years (mean 42·1 years). 459 (59%) of 773 patients were White, 677 (88%) patients were female, and 96 (12%) were male. 84 participants discontinued treatment during the trial, and 755 comprised the modified intent-to-treat population (atogepant 30 mg twice a day n=253, atogepant 60 mg once a day n=256, and placebo n=246). Baseline mean number of MMDs were 18·6 (SE 5·1) with atogepant 30 mg twice a day, 19·2 (5·3) with atogepant 60 mg once a day, and 18·9 (4·8) with placebo. Change from baseline in mean MMDs across 12 weeks was -7·5 (SE 0·4) with atogepant 30 mg twice a day, -6·9 (0·4) with atogepant 60 mg once a day, and -5·1 (0·4) with placebo. Least squares mean difference from placebo was -2·4 with atogepant 30 mg twice a day (95% CI -3·5 to -1·3; adjusted p<0·0001) and -1·8 with atogepant 60 mg once a day (-2·9 to -0·8; adjusted p=0·0009). Most common adverse events for atogepant were constipation (30 mg twice a day 28 [10·9%]; 60 mg once a day 26 [10%]; and placebo 8 [3%]) and nausea (30 mg twice a day 20 [8%]; 60 mg once a day 25 [10%]; and placebo 9 [4%]). Potentially clinically significant weight decrease (≥7% reduction at any time post-baseline) was observed in each treatment group (atogepant 30 mg twice a day 14 [6%]; atogepant 60 mg once a day 15 [6%]; and placebo 5 [2%]).Interpretation:Atogepant 30 mg twice a day and 60 mg once a day showed clinically relevant reductions in MMDs across 12 weeks in chronic migraine patients.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37486775,"Background:The risk of cardiovascular disease is increased among persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, so data regarding primary prevention strategies in this population are needed.Methods:In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 7769 participants with HIV infection with a low-to-moderate risk of cardiovascular disease who were receiving antiretroviral therapy to receive daily pitavastatin calcium (at a dose of 4 mg) or placebo. The primary outcome was the occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event, which was defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack, peripheral arterial ischemia, revascularization, or death from an undetermined cause.Results:The median age of the participants was 50 years (interquartile range, 45 to 55); the median CD4 count was 621 cells per cubic millimeter (interquartile range, 448 to 827), and the HIV RNA value was below quantification in 5250 of 5997 participants (87.5%) with available data. The trial was stopped early for efficacy after a median follow-up of 5.1 years (interquartile range, 4.3 to 5.9). The incidence of a major adverse cardiovascular event was 4.81 per 1000 person-years in the pitavastatin group and 7.32 per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.90; P = 0.002).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37466280,"Background:Findings from observational studies suggest that dietary patterns may offer protective benefits against cognitive decline, but data from clinical trials are limited. The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, known as the MIND diet, is a hybrid of the Mediterranean diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, with modifications to include foods that have been putatively associated with a decreased risk of dementia.Methods:We performed a two-site, randomized, controlled trial involving older adults without cognitive impairment but with a family history of dementia, a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) greater than 25, and a suboptimal diet, as determined by means of a 14-item questionnaire, to test the cognitive effects of the MIND diet with mild caloric restriction as compared with a control diet with mild caloric restriction. We assigned the participants in a 1:1 ratio to follow the intervention or the control diet for 3 years. All the participants received counseling regarding adherence to their assigned diet plus support to promote weight loss. The primary end point was the change from baseline in a global cognition score and four cognitive domain scores, all of which were derived from a 12-test battery. The raw scores from each test were converted to z scores, which were averaged across all tests to create the global cognition score and across component tests to create the four domain scores; higher scores indicate better cognitive performance. The secondary outcome was the change from baseline in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived measures of brain characteristics in a nonrandom sample of participants.Results:A total of 1929 persons underwent screening, and 604 were enrolled; 301 were assigned to the MIND-diet group and 303 to the control-diet group. The trial was completed by 93.4% of the participants. From baseline to year 3, improvements in global cognition scores were observed in both groups, with increases of 0.205 standardized units in the MIND-diet group and 0.170 standardized units in the control-diet group (mean difference, 0.035 standardized units; 95% confidence interval, -0.022 to 0.092; P = 0.23). Changes in white-matter hyperintensities, hippocampal volumes, and total gray- and white-matter volumes on MRI were similar in the two groups.Conclusions:Among cognitively unimpaired participants with a family history of dementia, changes in cognition and brain MRI outcomes from baseline to year 3 did not differ significantly between those who followed the MIND diet and those who followed the control diet with mild caloric restriction.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37460756,"Despite advances, few therapeutics have shown efficacy in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In a different context, virus-specific T cells have proven safe and effective. We conducted a randomized (2:1), open-label, phase 1/2 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of off-the-shelf, partially human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched, convalescent donor-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T cells (CoV-2-STs) in combination with standard of care (SoC) in patients with severe COVID-19 compared to SoC during Delta variant predominance. After a dose-escalated phase 1 safety study, 90 participants were randomized to receive CoV-2-ST+SoC (n = 60) or SoC only (n = 30). The co-primary objectives of the study were the composite of time to recovery and 30-d recovery rate and the in vivo expansion of CoV-2-STs in patients receiving CoV-2-ST+SoC over SoC. The key secondary objective was survival on day 60. CoV-2-ST+SoC treatment was safe and well tolerated. The study met the primary composite endpoint (CoV-2-ST+SoC versus SoC: recovery rate 65% versus 38%, P = 0.017; median recovery time 11 d versus not reached, P = 0.052, respectively; rate ratio for recovery 1.71 (95% confidence interval 1.03-2.83, P = 0.036)) and the co-primary objective of significant CoV-2-ST expansion compared to SοC (CoV-2-ST+SoC versus SoC, P = 0.047). Overall, in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, adoptive immunotherapy with CoV-2-STs was feasible and safe.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37423231,"Background:Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can be refractory to some or all treatment regimens, therefore new medications are needed to treat this population. This trial assessed the efficacy and safety of baricitinib, an oral Janus kinase 1/2-selective inhibitor, versus placebo in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.Methods:This phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, withdrawal, efficacy, and safety trial was conducted in 75 centres in 20 countries. We enrolled patients (aged 2 to <18 years) with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (positive or negative for rheumatoid factor), extended oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis, or juvenile psoriatic arthritis, and an inadequate response (after ≥12 weeks of treatment) or intolerance to one or more conventional synthetic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The trial consisted of a 2-week safety and pharmacokinetic period, a 12-week open-label lead-in period (10 weeks for the safety and pharmacokinetic subcohort), and an up to 32-week placebo-controlled double-blind withdrawal period. After age-based dosing was established in the safety and pharmacokinetic period, patients received a once-daily 4 mg adult-equivalent dose of baricitinib (tablets or suspension) in the open-label lead-in period. Patients meeting Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis-American College of Rheumatology (JIA-ACR) 30 criteria (JIA-ACR30 responders) at the end of the open-label lead-in (week 12) were eligible for random assignment (1:1) to receive placebo or continue receiving baricitinib, and remained in the double-blind withdrawal period until disease flare or up to the end of the double-blind withdrawal period (week 44). Patients and any personnel interacting directly with patients or sites were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was time to disease flare during the double-blind withdrawal period and was assessed in the intention-to-treat population of all randomly assigned patients. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of baricitinib throughout the three trial periods. For adverse events in the double-blind withdrawal period, exposure-adjusted incidence rates were calculated. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT03773978, and is completed.Findings:Between Dec 17, 2018 and March 3, 2021, 220 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of baricitinib (152 [69%] girls and 68 [31%] boys; median age 14·0 years [IQR 12·0-16·0]). 219 patients received baricitinib in the open-label lead-in period, of whom 163 (74%) had at least a JIA-ACR30 response at week 12 and were randomly assigned to placebo (n=81) or baricitinib (n=82) in the double-blind withdrawal period. Time to disease flare was significantly shorter with placebo versus baricitinib (hazard ratio 0·241 [95% CI 0·128-0·453], p<0·0001). Median time to flare was 27·14 weeks (95% CI 15·29-not estimable) in the placebo group, and not evaluable for patients in the baricitinib group (<50% had a flare event). Six (3%) of 220 patients had serious adverse events during the safety and pharmacokinetic period or open-label lead-in period. In the double-blind withdrawal period, serious adverse events were reported in four (5%) of 82 patients (incidence rate [IR] 9·7 [95% CI 2·7-24·9] per 100 patient-years at risk) in the baricitinib group and three (4%) of 81 (IR 10·2 [2·1-29·7]) in the placebo group. Treatment-emergent infections were reported during the safety and pharmacokinetic or open-label lead-in period in 55 (25%) of 220 patients, and during the double-blind withdrawal period in 31 (38%) of 82 (IR 102·1 [95% CI 69·3-144·9]) in the baricitinib group and 15 (19%) of 81 (IR 59·0 [33·0-97·3]) in the placebo group. Pulmonary embolism was reported as a serious adverse event in one patient (1%; IR 2·4 [95% CI 0·1-13·3]) in the baricitinib group in the double-blind withdrawal period, which was judged to be related to study treatment.Interpretation:Baricitinib was efficacious with an acceptable safety profile in the treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, extended oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis, and juvenile psoriatic arthritis, after inadequate response or intolerance to standard therapy.Funding:Eli Lilly and Company under licence from Incyte."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37326325,"Background:Whether video laryngoscopy as compared with direct laryngoscopy increases the likelihood of successful tracheal intubation on the first attempt among critically ill adults is uncertain.Methods:In a multicenter, randomized trial conducted at 17 emergency departments and intensive care units (ICUs), we randomly assigned critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation to the video-laryngoscope group or the direct-laryngoscope group. The primary outcome was successful intubation on the first attempt. The secondary outcome was the occurrence of severe complications during intubation; severe complications were defined as severe hypoxemia, severe hypotension, new or increased vasopressor use, cardiac arrest, or death.Results:The trial was stopped for efficacy at the time of the single preplanned interim analysis. Among 1417 patients who were included in the final analysis (91.5% of whom underwent intubation that was performed by an emergency medicine resident or a critical care fellow), successful intubation on the first attempt occurred in 600 of the 705 patients (85.1%) in the video-laryngoscope group and in 504 of the 712 patients (70.8%) in the direct-laryngoscope group (absolute risk difference, 14.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.9 to 18.7; P<0.001). A total of 151 patients (21.4%) in the video-laryngoscope group and 149 patients (20.9%) in the direct-laryngoscope group had a severe complication during intubation (absolute risk difference, 0.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -3.9 to 4.9). Safety outcomes, including esophageal intubation, injury to the teeth, and aspiration, were similar in the two groups.Conclusions:Among critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation in an emergency department or ICU, the use of a video laryngoscope resulted in a higher incidence of successful intubation on the first attempt than the use of a direct laryngoscope.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37326323,"Background:Several studies have suggested that patients with kidney failure may benefit from high-dose hemodiafiltration as compared with standard hemodialysis. However, given the limitations of the various published studies, additional data are needed.Methods:We conducted a pragmatic, multinational, randomized, controlled trial involving patients with kidney failure who had received high-flux hemodialysis for at least 3 months. All the patients were deemed to be candidates for a convection volume of at least 23 liters per session (as required for high-dose hemodiafiltration) and were able to complete patient-reported outcome assessments. The patients were assigned to receive high-dose hemodiafiltration or continuation of conventional high-flux hemodialysis. The primary outcome was death from any cause. Key secondary outcomes were cause-specific death, a composite of fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events, kidney transplantation, and recurrent all-cause or infection-related hospitalizations.Results:A total of 1360 patients underwent randomization: 683 to receive high-dose hemodiafiltration and 677 to receive high-flux hemodialysis. The median follow-up was 30 months (interquartile range, 27 to 38). The mean convection volume during the trial in the hemodiafiltration group was 25.3 liters per session. Death from any cause occurred in 118 patients (17.3%) in the hemodiafiltration group and in 148 patients (21.9%) in the hemodialysis group (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.65 to 0.93).Conclusions:In patients with kidney failure resulting in kidney-replacement therapy, the use of high-dose hemodiafiltration resulted in a lower risk of death from any cause than conventional high-flux hemodialysis.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37230105,"Background:In previous trials, point-of-care testing of C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations safely reduced antibiotic use in non-severe acute respiratory infections in primary care. However, these trials were done in a research-oriented context with close support from research staff, which could have influenced prescribing practices. To better inform the potential for scaling up point-of-care testing of CRP in respiratory infections, we aimed to do a pragmatic trial of the intervention in a routine care setting.Methods:We did a pragmatic, cluster-randomised controlled trial at 48 commune health centres in Viet Nam between June 1, 2020, and May 12, 2021. Eligible centres served populations of more than 3000 people, handled 10-40 respiratory infections per week, had licensed prescribers on site, and maintained electronic patient databases. Centres were randomly allocated (1:1) to provide point-of-care CRP testing plus routine care or routine care only. Randomisation was stratified by district and by baseline prescription level (ie, the proportion of patients with suspected acute respiratory infections to whom antibiotics were prescribed in 2019). Eligible patients were aged 1-65 years and visiting the commune health centre for a suspected acute respiratory infection with at least one focal sign or symptom and symptoms lasting less than 7 days. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients prescribed an antibiotic at first attendance in the intention-to-treat population. The per-protocol analysis included only people who underwent CRP testing. Secondary safety outcomes included time to resolution of symptoms and frequency of hospitalisation. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT03855215.Findings:48 commune health centres were enrolled and randomly assigned, 24 to the intervention group (n=18 621 patients) and 24 to the control group (n=21 235). 17 345 (93·1%) patients in the intervention group were prescribed antibiotics, compared with 20 860 (98·2%) in the control group (adjusted relative risk 0·83 [95% CI 0·66-0·93]). Only 2606 (14%) of 18 621 patients in the intervention group underwent CRP testing and were included in the per-protocol analysis. When analyses were restricted to this population, larger reductions in prescribing were noted in the intervention group compared with the control group (adjusted relative risk 0·64 [95% CI 0·60-0·70]). Time to resolution of symptoms (hazard ratio 0·70 [95% CI 0·39-1·27]) and frequency of hospitalisation (nine in the intervention group vs 17 in the control group; adjusted relative risk 0·52 [95% CI 0·23-1·17]) did not differ between groups.Interpretation:Use of point-of-care CRP testing efficaciously reduced prescription of antibiotics in patients with non-severe acute respiratory infections in primary health care in Viet Nam without compromising patient recovery. The low uptake of CRP testing suggests that barriers to implementation and compliance need to be addressed before scale-up of the intervention.Funding:Australian Government, UK Government, and the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37216958,"Background:Heterologous boosting is suggested to be of use in populations who have received inactivated COVID-19 vaccines. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a heterologous vaccination with the mRNA vaccine CS-2034 versus the inactivated BBIBP-CorV as a fourth dose, as well as the efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 omicron (BA.5) variant.Methods:This trial contains a randomised, double-blind, parallel-controlled study in healthy participants aged 18 years or older (group A) and an open-label cohort in participants 60 years and older (group B), who had received three doses of inactivated whole-virion vaccines at least 6 months before enrolment. Pregnant women and people with major chronic illnesses or a history of allergies were excluded. Eligible participants in group A were stratified by age (18-59 years and ≥60 years) and then randomised by SAS 9.4 in a ratio of 3:1 to receive a dose of the mRNA vaccine (CS-2034, CanSino, Shanghai, China) or inactivated vaccine (BBIBP-CorV, Sinopharm, Beijing, China). Safety and immunogenicity against omicron variants of the fourth dose were evaluated in group A. Participants 60 years and older were involved in group B for safety observations. The primary outcome was geometric mean titres (GMTs) of the neutralising antibodies against omicron and seroconversion rates against BA.5 variant 28 days after the boosting, and incidence of adverse reactions within 28 days. The intention-to-treat group was involved in the safety analysis, while all patients in group A who had blood samples taken before and after the booster were involved in the immunogenicity analysis. This trial was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry Centre (ChiCTR2200064575).Findings:Between Oct 13, and Nov 22, 2022, 320 participants were enrolled in group A (240 in the CS-2034 group and 80 in the BBIBP-CorV group) and 113 in group B. Adverse reactions after vaccination were more frequent in CS-2034 recipients (158 [44·8%]) than BBIBP-CorV recipients (17 [21·3%], p<0·0001). However, most adverse reactions were mild or moderate, with grade 3 adverse reactions only reported by eight (2%) of 353 participants receiving CS-2034. Heterologous boosting with CS-2034 elicited 14·4-fold (GMT 229·3, 95% CI 202·7-259·4 vs 15·9, 13·1-19·4) higher concentration of neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant BA.5 than did homologous boosting with BBIBP-CorV. The seroconversion rates of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralising antibody responses were much higher in the mRNA heterologous booster regimen compared with BBIBP-CorV homologous booster regimen (original strain 47 [100%] of 47 vs three [18·8%] of 16; BA.1 45 [95·8%] of 48 vs two [12·5%] 16; and BA.5 233 [98·3%] of 240 vs 15 [18·8%] of 80 by day 28).Interpretation:Both the administration of mRNA vaccine CS-2034 and inactivated vaccine BBIBP-CorV as a fourth dose were well tolerated. Heterologous boosting with mRNA vaccine CS-2034 induced higher immune responses and protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 omicron infections compared with homologous boosting, which could support the emergency use authorisation of CS-2034 in adults.Funding:Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai, National Natural Science Foundation of China, Jiangsu Provincial Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars, and Jiangsu Provincial Key Project of Science and Technology Plan.Translation:For the Chinese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37182534,"Background:An urgent need exists for antibiotics to treat infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (ABC). Sulbactam-durlobactam is a β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combination with activity against Acinetobacter, including multidrug-resistant strains. In a phase 3, pathogen-specific, randomised controlled trial, we compared the efficacy and safety of sulbactam-durlobactam versus colistin, both in combination with imipenem-cilastatin as background therapy, in patients with serious infections caused by carbapenem-resistant ABC.Methods:The ATTACK trial was done at 59 clinical sites in 16 countries. Adults aged 18 years or older with ABC-confirmed hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, ventilated pneumonia, or bloodstream infections were randomised 1:1 using a block size of four to sulbactam-durlobactam (1·0 g of each drug in combination over 3 h every 6 h) or colistin (2·5 mg/kg over 30 min every 12 h) for 7-14 days. All patients received imipenem-cilastatin (1·0 g of each drug in combination over 1 h every 6 h) as background therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with laboratory-confirmed carbapenem-resistant ABC (the carbapenem-resistant ABC microbiologically modified intention-to-treat population). Non-inferiority was concluded if the upper bound of the 95% CI for the treatment difference was less than +20%. The primary safety endpoint was incidence of nephrotoxicity assessed using modified Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage renal disease criteria measured by creatinine level or glomerular filtration rate through day 42. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT03894046.Findings:Between Sep 5, 2019, and July 26, 2021, 181 patients were randomly assigned to sulbactam-durlobactam or colistin (176 hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, or ventilated pneumonia; and five bloodstream infections); 125 patients with laboratory-confirmed carbapenem-resistant ABC isolates were included in the primary efficacy analysis. 28-day all-cause mortality was 12 (19%) of 63 in the sulbactam-durlobactam group and 20 (32%) of 62 in the colistin group, a difference of -13·2% (95% CI -30·0 to 3·5), which met criteria for non-inferiority. Incidence of nephrotoxicity was significantly (p<0·001) lower with sulbactam-durlobactam than colistin (12 [13%] of 91 vs 32 [38%] of 85). Serious adverse events were reported in 36 (40%) of 91 patients in the sulbactam-durlobactam group and 42 (49%) of 86 patients in the colistin group. Treatment-related adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation were reported in ten (11%) of 91 patients in the sulbactam-durlobactam group and 14 (16%) of 86 patients in the colistin group.Interpretation:Our data show that sulbactam-durlobactam was non-inferior to colistin, both agents given in combination with imipenem-cilastatin, for the primary endpoint of 28-day all-cause mortality. Sulbactam-durlobactam was well tolerated and could be an effective intervention to reduce mortality from serious infections caused by carbapenem-resistant ABC, including multidrug-resistant strains.Funding:Entasis Therapeutics and Zai Lab."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37127047,"Background:Current supply shortages constrain yellow fever vaccination activities, particularly outbreak response. Although fractional doses of all WHO-prequalified yellow fever vaccines have been shown to be safe and immunogenic in a randomised controlled trial in adults, they have not been evaluated in a randomised controlled trial in young children (9-59 months old). We aimed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of fractional doses compared with standard doses of the WHO-prequalified 17D-213 vaccine in young children.Methods:This substudy of the YEFE phase 4 study was conducted at the Epicentre Mbarara Research Centre (Mbarara, Uganda). Eligible children were aged 9-59 months without contraindications for vaccination, without history of previous yellow fever vaccination or infection and not requiring yellow fever vaccination for travelling. Participants were randomly assigned, using block randomisation, 1:1 to standard or fractional (one-fifth) dose of yellow fever vaccine. Investigators, participants, and laboratory personnel were blinded to group allocation. Participants were followed for immunogenicity and safety at 10 days, 28 days, and 1 year after vaccination. The primary outcome was non-inferiority in seroconversion (-10 percentage point margin) 28 days after vaccination measured by 50% plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT50) in the per-protocol population. Safety and seroconversion at 10 days and 12-16 months after vaccination (given COVID-19 resctrictions) were secondary outcomes. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT02991495.Findings:Between Feb 20, 2019, and Sept 9, 2019, 433 children were assessed, and 420 were randomly assigned to fractional dose (n=210) and to standard dose (n=210) 17D-213 vaccination. 28 days after vaccination, 202 (97%, 95% CI 95-99) of 207 participants in the fractional dose group and 191 (100%, 98-100) of 191 in the standard dose group seroconverted. The absolute difference in seroconversion between the study groups in the per-protocol population was -2 percentage points (95% CI -5 to 1). 154 (73%) of 210 participants in the fractional dose group and 168 (80%) of 210 in the standard dose group reported at least one adverse event 28 days after vaccination. At 10 days follow-up, seroconversion was lower in the fractional dose group than in the standard dose group. The most common adverse events were upper respiratory tract infections (n=221 [53%]), diarrhoea (n=68 [16%]), rhinorrhoea (n=49 [12%]), and conjunctivitis (n=28 [7%]). No difference was observed in incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events between study groups.Conclusions:Fractional doses of the 17D-213 vaccine were non-inferior to standard doses in inducing seroconversion 28 days after vaccination in children aged 9-59 months when assessed with PRNT50, but we found fewer children seroconverted at 10 days. The results support consideration of the use of fractional dose of yellow fever vaccines in WHO recommendations for outbreak response in the event of a yellow fever vaccine shortage to include children.Funding:Médecins Sans Frontières Foundation."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37127045,"Background:Evidence indicates that fractional doses of yellow fever vaccine are safe and sufficiently immunogenic for use during yellow fever outbreaks. However, there are no data on the generalisability of this observation to populations living with HIV. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity of fractional and standard doses of yellow fever vaccine in HIV-positive adults.Methods:We conducted a randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority substudy in Kilifi, coastal Kenya to compare the immunogenicity and safety of a fractional dose (one-fifth of the standard dose) versus the standard dose of 17D-213 yellow fever vaccine among HIV-positive volunteers. HIV-positive participants aged 18-59 years, with baseline CD4+T-cell count of at least 200 cells per mL, and who were not pregnant, had no previous history of yellow fever vaccination or infection, and had no contraindication for yellow fever vaccination were recruited from the community. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 in blocks (variable block sizes) to either a fractional dose or a standard dose of the 17D-213 yellow fever vaccine. Vaccines were administered subcutaneously by an unblinded nurse and pharmacist; all other study personnel were blinded to the vaccine allocation. The primary outcome of the study was the proportion of participants who seroconverted by the plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT50) 28 days after vaccination for the fractional dose versus the standard dose in the per-protocol population. Secondary outcomes were assessment of adverse events and immunogenicity during the 1-year follow-up period. Participants were considered to have seroconverted if the post-vaccination antibody titre was at least 4 times greater than the pre-vaccination titre. We set a non-inferiority margin of not less than a 17% decrease in seroconversion in the fractional dose compared with the standard dose. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT02991495.Findings:Between Jan 29, 2019, and May 17, 2019, 303 participants were screened, and 250 participants were included and vaccinated; 126 participants were assigned to the fractional dose and 124 to the standard dose. 28 days after vaccination, 112 (96%, 95% CI 90-99) of 117 participants in the fractional dose group and 115 (98%, 94-100) of 117 in the standard dose group seroconverted by PRNT50. The difference in seroconversion between the fractional dose and the standard dose was -3% (95% CI -7 to 2). Fractional dosing therefore met the non-inferiority criterion, and non-inferiority was maintained for 1 year. The most common adverse events were headache (n=31 [12%]), fatigue (n=23 [9%]), myalgia (n=23 [9%]), and cough (n=14 [6%]). Reported adverse events were either mild (182 [97%] of 187 adverse events) or moderate (5 [3%]) and were self-limiting.Interpretation:Fractional doses of the 17D-213 yellow fever vaccine were sufficiently immunogenic and safe demonstrating non-inferiority to the standard vaccine dose in HIV-infected individuals with CD4+T cell counts of at least 200 cells per mL. These results provide confidence that fractional dose recommendations are applicable to populations with high HIV prevalence.Funding:Wellcome Trust, Médecins Sans Frontières Foundation, and the UK Department for International Development."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37116527,"Background:Single-occupancy isolation rooms are a finite resource in UK hospitals but are crucial in preventing transmission of infection. Patients with suspected gastroenteritis are nursed in single-occupancy rooms, but delays in laboratory testing lead to non-infectious patients remaining isolated for prolonged periods unnecessarily. Rapid molecular test panels for gastrointestinal pathogens have a run time of around 1 h but their clinical impact is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of syndromic molecular point-of-care testing (mPOCT) for gastrointestinal pathogens in adult patients presenting to hospital with suspected gastroenteritis on single-occupancy room use and a range of other outcome measures.Methods:In this pragmatic, open-label, randomised controlled trial, we enrolled adults hospitalised with suspected gastroenteritis in a large UK hospital. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive syndromic mPOCT of stool or rectal samples, or to routine clinical care (control) with laboratory testing. The primary outcome was the duration of time in single-occupancy rooms assessed on a modified intention-to-treat basis. Secondary outcomes included the time to results, time to de-isolation, antibiotic use, and safety outcomes. The study was registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN88918395, and is complete.Findings:Between March 20, 2017 and March 17, 2020, from 455 patients assessed for eligibility, we enrolled 278 patients, 138 assigned to mPOCT (one withdrawal) and 140 to the control group. The duration (geometric mean) of single-occupancy room isolation was 1·8 days (95% CI 1·5-2·2) in the mPOCT group compared with 2·6 days (2·2-3·0) in the control group (exponentiated coefficient 0·70 [95% CI 0·56 to 0·87]; p=0·0017). The median (IQR) time to results was 1·7 h (1·5-2·0) for mPOCT and 44·7 h (21·2-66·1) for the control group (p<0·0001). Time to de-isolation was 0·6 days (0·3-1·8) in the mPOCT group compared with 2·2 days (1·2-3·2) in the control group, (p<0·0001). Antibiotics were given in 89 (65%) of 137 in the mPOCT group and 66 (47%) of 140 in the control group (p=0·0028). There were no differences between groups in length of hospital stay, or in safety outcomes including mortality, intensive care unit admission, or readmission to hospital.Interpretation:mPOCT for gastrointestinal pathogens in patients with suspected gastroenteritis returned results more rapidly than conventional testing and was associated with a reduction in single-occupancy room use. However, these benefits need to be balanced against a potential increase in antibiotic use.Funding:University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37100061,"Background:Meglumine antimoniate (MA) remains the main treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Uncontrolled studies suggest that intralesional MA (IL-MA) may be noninferior and safer than systemic MA (S-MA).Methods:Multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of IL-MA in 3 infiltrations at 14-day intervals compared with S-MA (10-20 mg Sb5+/kg/day, 20 days) for CL, with noninferiority margin of 20%. Primary and secondary outcomes were definitive cure at day 180 and epithelialization rate at day 90 of treatment, respectively. A 2-year follow-up was performed to assess relapses and emergence of mucosal lesions. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored according to the Division of AIDS AE grading system.Results:We evaluated 135 patients. The cure rates (95% confidence interval) for IL-MA and S-MA treatment were, respectively, 82.8% (70.5-91.4) and 67.8% (53.3-78.3) per protocol (PP) and 70.6% (58.3-81.0) and 59.7% (47.0-71.5) per intention to treat (ITT). The epithelialization rates of the IL-MA and S-MA treatment were, respectively, 79.3% (66.6-88 + 8) and 71.2% (57.9-82.2) PP and 69.1% (55.2-78.5) and 64.2% (50.0-74.2) ITT.

Ten participants in the S-MA group and 1 in the IL-MA group were discontinued due to severe or persistent AEs.Conclusions:IL-MA provides a similar cure rate and results in less toxicity compared with S-MA and may be used as first-line therapy for CL patients.Clinical trials registration:REBEC: RBR-6mk5n4."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37088096,"Background:Bivalent mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines encoding the ancestral and omicron spike (S) protein were developed as a countermeasure against antigenically distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants. We aimed to assess the (variant-specific) immunogenicity and reactogenicity of mRNA-based bivalent omicron (BA.1) vaccines in individuals who were primed with adenovirus-based or mRNA-based vaccines encoding the ancestral spike protein.Methods:We analysed results of the direct boost group of the SWITCH ON study, an open-label, multicentre, randomised controlled trial. Health-care workers from four academic hospitals in the Netherlands aged 18-65 years who had completed a primary COVID-19 vaccination regimen and received one booster of an mRNA-based vaccine, given no later than 3 months previously, were eligible. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using computer software in block sizes of 16 and 24 to receive an omicron BA.1 bivalent booster straight away (direct boost group) or a bivalent omicron BA.5 booster, postponed for 90 days (postponed boost group), stratified by priming regimen. The BNT162b2 OMI BA.1 boost was given to participants younger than 45 years, and the mRNA-1273.214 boost was given to participants 45 years or older, as per Dutch guidelines. The direct boost group, whose results are presented here, were divided into four subgroups for analysis: (1) Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson & Johnson) prime and BNT162b2 OMI BA.1 (BioNTech-Pfizer) boost (Ad/P), (2) mRNA-based prime and BNT162b2 OMI BA.1 boost (mRNA/P), (3) Ad26.COV2.S prime and mRNA-1273.214 (Moderna) boost (Ad/M), and (4) mRNA-based prime and mRNA-1273.214 boost (mRNA/M). The primary outcome was fold change in S protein S1 subunit-specific IgG antibodies before and 28 days after booster vaccination. The primary outcome and safety were assessed in all participants except those who withdrew, had a SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection, or had a missing blood sample at day 0 or day 28. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT05471440.Findings:Between Sept 2 and Oct 4, 2022, 219 (50%) of 434 eligible participants were randomly assigned to the direct boost group; 187 participants were included in the primary analyses; exclusions were mainly due to SARS-CoV-2 infection between days 0 and 28. From the 187 included participants, 138 (74%) were female and 49 (26%) were male. 42 (22%) of 187 participants received Ad/P and 44 (24%) mRNA/P (those aged <45 years), and 45 (24%) had received Ad/M and 56 (30%) mRNA/M (those aged ≥45 years). S1-specific binding antibody concentrations increased 7 days after bivalent booster vaccination and remained stable over 28 days in all four subgroups (geometric mean ratio [GMR] between day 0 and day 28 was 1·15 [95% CI 1·12-1·19] for the Ad/P group, 1·17 [1·14-1·20] for the mRNA/P group, 1·20 [1·17-1·23] for the Ad/M group, and 1·16 [1·13-1·19] for the mRNA/M group). We observed no significant difference in the GMR between the Ad/P and mRNA/P groups (p=0·51). The GMR appeared to be higher in the Ad/M group than in the mRNA/M group, but was not significant (p=0·073). Most side-effects were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within 48 h in most individuals.Interpretation:Booster vaccination with mRNA-1273.214 or BNT162b2 OMI BA.1 in adult healthcare workers resulted in a rapid recall of humoral and cellular immune responses independent of the priming regimen. Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 immunity at the population level, and simultaneously antigenic drift at the virus level, remains crucial to assess the necessity and timing of COVID-19 variant-specific booster vaccinations.Funding:The Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw)."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37021692,"Background:Current guidelines recommend annual community-wide mass administration of azithromycin for trachoma. Targeting treatments to those most likely to be infected could reduce the amount of unnecessary antibiotics distributed.Methods:In a cluster-randomized trial conducted from 1 November 2010 through 8 November 2013, 48 Ethiopian communities previously treated with annual mass azithromycin distributions for trachoma were randomized in equal numbers to (1) annual azithromycin distributions targeted to children aged 0-5 years, (2) annual azithromycin distributions targeted to households with a child aged 0-5 years found to have clinically active trachoma, (3) continued annual mass azithromycin distributions to the entire community, or (4) cessation of treatment. The primary outcome was the community prevalence of ocular chlamydia infection among children aged 0-9 years at month 36. Laboratory personnel were masked to treatment allocation.Results:The prevalence of ocular chlamydia infection among children aged 0-9 years increased from 4.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], .9%-8.6%) at baseline to 8.7% (95% CI, 4.2%-13.9%) at month 36 in the age-targeted arm, and from 2.8% (95% CI, .8%-5.3%) at baseline to 6.3% (95% CI, 2.9%-10.6%) at month 36 in the household-targeted arm. After adjusting for baseline chlamydia prevalence, the 36-month prevalence of ocular chlamydia was 2.4 percentage points greater in the age-targeted group (95% CI, -4.8% to 9.6%; P = .50; prespecified primary analysis). No adverse events were reported.Conclusions:Targeting azithromycin treatment to preschool children was no different than targeting azithromycin to households with a child with clinically active trachoma. Neither approach reduced ocular chlamydia over the 3-year study.Clinical trials registration:NCT01202331."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37622677,"Background:Device-detected atrial high-rate episodes (AHREs) are atrial arrhythmias detected by implanted cardiac devices. AHREs resemble atrial fibrillation but are rare and brief. Whether the occurrence of AHREs in patients without atrial fibrillation (as documented on a conventional electrocardiogram [ECG]) justifies the initiation of anticoagulants is not known.Methods:We conducted an event-driven, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized trial involving patients 65 years of age or older who had AHREs lasting for at least 6 minutes and who had at least one additional risk factor for stroke. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive edoxaban or placebo. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or systemic embolism, evaluated in a time-to-event analysis. The safety outcome was a composite of death from any cause or major bleeding.Results:The analysis population consisted of 2536 patients (1270 in the edoxaban group and 1266 in the placebo group). The mean age was 78 years, 37.4% were women, and the median duration of AHREs was 2.8 hours. The trial was terminated early, at a median follow-up of 21 months, on the basis of safety concerns and the results of an independent, informal assessment of futility for the efficacy of edoxaban; at termination, the planned enrollment had been completed. A primary efficacy outcome event occurred in 83 patients (3.2% per patient-year) in the edoxaban group and in 101 patients (4.0% per patient-year) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60 to 1.08; P = 0.15). The incidence of stroke was approximately 1% per patient-year in both groups. A safety outcome event occurred in 149 patients (5.9% per patient-year) in the edoxaban group and in 114 patients (4.5% per patient-year) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.67; P = 0.03). ECG-diagnosed atrial fibrillation developed in 462 of 2536 patients (18.2% total, 8.7% per patient-year).Conclusions:Among patients with AHREs detected by implantable devices, anticoagulation with edoxaban did not significantly reduce the incidence of a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or systemic embolism as compared with placebo, but it led to a higher incidence of a composite of death or major bleeding. The incidence of stroke was low in both groups.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37754283,"Background:Randomized, controlled trials have shown both benefit and harm from tight blood-glucose control in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Variation in the use of early parenteral nutrition and in insulin-induced severe hypoglycemia might explain this inconsistency.Methods:We randomly assigned patients, on ICU admission, to liberal glucose control (insulin initiated only when the blood-glucose level was >215 mg per deciliter [>11.9 mmol per liter]) or to tight glucose control (blood-glucose level targeted with the use of the LOGIC-Insulin algorithm at 80 to 110 mg per deciliter [4.4 to 6.1 mmol per liter]); parenteral nutrition was withheld in both groups for 1 week. Protocol adherence was determined according to glucose metrics. The primary outcome was the length of time that ICU care was needed, calculated on the basis of time to discharge alive from the ICU, with death accounted for as a competing risk; 90-day mortality was the safety outcome.Results:Of 9230 patients who underwent randomization, 4622 were assigned to liberal glucose control and 4608 to tight glucose control. The median morning blood-glucose level was 140 mg per deciliter (interquartile range, 122 to 161) with liberal glucose control and 107 mg per deciliter (interquartile range, 98 to 117) with tight glucose control. Severe hypoglycemia occurred in 31 patients (0.7%) in the liberal-control group and 47 patients (1.0%) in the tight-control group. The length of time that ICU care was needed was similar in the two groups (hazard ratio for earlier discharge alive with tight glucose control, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.96 to 1.04; P = 0.94). Mortality at 90 days was also similar (10.1% with liberal glucose control and 10.5% with tight glucose control, P = 0.51). Analyses of eight prespecified secondary outcomes suggested that the incidence of new infections, the duration of respiratory and hemodynamic support, the time to discharge alive from the hospital, and mortality in the ICU and hospital were similar in the two groups, whereas severe acute kidney injury and cholestatic liver dysfunction appeared less prevalent with tight glucose control.Conclusions:In critically ill patients who were not receiving early parenteral nutrition, tight glucose control did not affect the length of time that ICU care was needed or mortality.

Patients were randomized to a duration of antiviral prophylaxis based on immune monitoring (intervention) or a fixed duration (control). Patients in the control group were planned to receive 180 days (CMV-seronegative) or 90 days (CMV-seropositive) of valganciclovir. Patients were assessed monthly with a CMV ELISpot assay (T-Track CMV); prophylaxis in the intervention group was stopped if the assay was positive. The co-primary outcomes were the proportion of patients with clinically significant CMV infection and reduction in days of prophylaxis. Between-group differences were adjusted for CMV serostatus.Results:Overall, 193 patients were randomized (92 in the immune-monitoring group and 101 in the control group), of whom 185 had evaluation of the primary outcome (87 and 98 patients). CMV infection occurred in 26 of 87 (adjusted percentage, 30.9%) in the immune-monitoring group and in 32 of 98 (adjusted percentage, 31.1%) in the control group (adjusted risk difference, -0.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], -13.0% to 12.7%; P = .064). The duration of prophylaxis was shorter in the immune-monitoring group (adjusted difference, -26.0 days; 95%, CI, -41.1 to -10.8 days; P < .001).Conclusions:Immune monitoring resulted in a significant reduction of antiviral prophylaxis, but we were unable to establish noninferiority of this approach on the co-primary outcome of CMV infection.Clinical trials registration:NCT02538172."

Nonhospitalized adults 30 years of age or older who had at least two symptoms of acute infection that had been present for no more than 7 days before enrollment were randomly assigned to receive inhaled fluticasone furoate at a dose of 200 μg once daily for 14 days or placebo. The primary outcome was the time to sustained recovery, defined as the third of 3 consecutive days without symptoms. Key secondary outcomes included hospitalization or death by day 28 and a composite outcome of the need for an urgent-care or emergency department visit or hospitalization or death through day 28.Results:Of the 1407 enrolled participants who underwent randomization, 715 were assigned to receive inhaled fluticasone furoate and 692 to receive placebo, and 656 and 621, respectively, were included in the analysis. There was no evidence that the use of fluticasone furoate resulted in a shorter time to recovery than placebo (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% credible interval, 0.91 to 1.12; posterior probability of benefit [defined as a hazard ratio >1], 0.56).

The primary outcome was the occurrence of the first UTI during the trial period. Secondary outcomes included new kidney scarring and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at 24 months.Results:A total of 292 participants underwent randomization (146 per group). Approximately 75% of the participants were male; the median age was 3 months, and 235 participants (80.5%) had grade IV or V vesicoureteral reflux. In the intention-to-treat analysis, a first UTI occurred in 31 participants (21.2%) in the prophylaxis group and in 52 participants (35.6%) in the untreated group (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.86; P = 0.008); the number needed to treat for 2 years to prevent one UTI was 7 children (95% CI, 4 to 29). Among untreated participants, 64.4% had no UTI during the trial. The incidence of new kidney scars and the estimated GFR at 24 months did not differ substantially between the two groups. Pseudomonas species, other non-Escherichia coliorganisms, and antibiotic resistance were more common in UTI isolates obtained from participants in the prophylaxis group than in isolates obtained from those in the untreated group. Serious adverse events were similar in the two groups.Conclusions:In infants with grade III, IV, or V vesicoureteral reflux and no previous UTIs, continuous antibiotic prophylaxis provided a small but significant benefit in preventing a first UTI despite an increased occurrence of non-E. coliorganisms and antibiotic resistance.

Upacicalcet, a new injectable calcimimetic, acts on calcium-sensing receptors to suppress parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. We examined the efficacy and safety of upacicalcet in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism receiving HD.Methods:In this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomized Japanese patients undergoing HD with serum intact PTH (iPTH) concentrations >240 pg/ml and corrected calcium concentrations ≥8.4 mg/dl. Either upacicalcet or placebo was administered after each HD session for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was the percentage of participants achieving the target mean serum iPTH concentration (60-240 pg/ml) at weeks 22-24.Results:A total of 103 participants received upacicalcet, and 50 participants received the placebo. The percentage of participants achieving mean serum iPTH concentrations of 60-240 pg/ml during the evaluation period was 67% (69/103) in the upacicalcet group and 8% (4/50) in the placebo group. The difference between the two groups was 59% (95% confidence interval, 48% to 71%).

Functionally significant nonculprit lesions were identified either by pressure wire or angiography. The primary outcome was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or any revascularization at 1 year. The key secondary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction. Safety was assessed as a composite of contrast-associated acute kidney injury, stroke, or bleeding.Results:A total of 1445 patients underwent randomization (720 to receive complete revascularization and 725 to receive culprit-only revascularization). The median age of the patients was 80 years (interquartile range, 77 to 84); 528 patients (36.5%) were women, and 509 (35.2%) were admitted for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

Additional evidence about the effects of ferric carboxymaltose on clinical events is needed.Methods:In this double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned ambulatory patients with heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less, and iron deficiency, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive intravenous ferric carboxymaltose or placebo, in addition to standard therapy for heart failure. Ferric carboxymaltose or placebo was given every 6 months as needed on the basis of iron indexes and hemoglobin levels. The primary outcome was a hierarchical composite of death within 12 months after randomization, hospitalizations for heart failure within 12 months after randomization, or change from baseline to 6 months in the 6-minute walk distance. The significance level was set at 0.01.Results:We enrolled 3065 patients, of whom 1532 were randomly assigned to the ferric carboxymaltose group and 1533 to the placebo group. Death by month 12 occurred in 131 patients (8.6%) in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 158 (10.3%) in the placebo group; a total of 297 and 332 hospitalizations for heart failure, respectively, occurred by month 12; and the mean (±SD) change from baseline to 6 months in the 6-minute walk distance was 8±60 and 4±59 m, respectively (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney P = 0.02; unmatched win ratio, 1.10; 99% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.23). Repeated dosing of ferric carboxymaltose appeared to be safe with an acceptable adverse-event profile in the majority of patients. The number of patients with serious adverse events occurring during the treatment period was similar in the two groups (413 patients [27.0%] in the ferric carboxymaltose group and 401 [26.2%] in the placebo group).Conclusions:Among ambulatory patients who had heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction and iron deficiency, there was no apparent difference between ferric carboxymaltose and placebo with respect to the hierarchical composite of death, hospitalizations for heart failure, or 6-minute walk distance.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37622681,"Background:Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is increasing in prevalence and is associated with a high symptom burden and functional impairment, especially in persons with obesity. No therapies have been approved to target obesity-related heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.Methods:We randomly assigned 529 patients who had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or higher to receive once-weekly semaglutide (2.4 mg) or placebo for 52 weeks. The dual primary end points were the change from baseline in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary score (KCCQ-CSS; scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating fewer symptoms and physical limitations) and the change in body weight. Confirmatory secondary end points included the change in the 6-minute walk distance; a hierarchical composite end point that included death, heart failure events, and differences in the change in the KCCQ-CSS and 6-minute walk distance; and the change in the C-reactive protein (CRP) level.Results:The mean change in the KCCQ-CSS was 16.6 points with semaglutide and 8.7 points with placebo (estimated difference, 7.8 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8 to 10.9; P<0.001), and the mean percentage change in body weight was -13.3% with semaglutide and -2.6% with placebo (estimated difference, -10.7 percentage points; 95% CI, -11.9 to -9.4; P<0.001). The mean change in the 6-minute walk distance was 21.5 m with semaglutide and 1.2 m with placebo (estimated difference, 20.3 m; 95% CI, 8.6 to 32.1; P<0.001). In the analysis of the hierarchical composite end point, semaglutide produced more wins than placebo (win ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.37 to 2.15; P<0.001). The mean percentage change in the CRP level was -43.5% with semaglutide and -7.3% with placebo (estimated treatment ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.72; P<0.001). Serious adverse events were reported in 35 participants (13.3%) in the semaglutide group and 71 (26.7%) in the placebo group.Conclusions:In patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and obesity, treatment with semaglutide (2.4 mg) led to larger reductions in symptoms and physical limitations, greater improvements in exercise function, and greater weight loss than placebo.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37591292,"Background:IgA nephropathy is a chronic immune-mediated kidney disease and a major cause of kidney failure worldwide. The gut mucosal immune system is implicated in its pathogenesis, and Nefecon is a novel, oral, targeted-release formulation of budesonide designed to act at the gut mucosal level. We present findings from the 2-year, phase 3 NefIgArd trial of Nefecon in patients with IgA nephropathy.Methods:In this phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with primary IgA nephropathy, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 35-90 mL/min per 1·73 m2, and persistent proteinuria (urine protein-creatinine ratio ≥0·8 g/g or proteinuria ≥1 g/24 h) despite optimised renin-angiotensin system blockade were enrolled at 132 hospital-based clinical sites in 20 countries worldwide. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 16 mg/day oral capsules of Nefecon or matching placebo for 9 months, followed by a 15-month observational follow-up period off study drug. Randomisation via an interactive response technology system was stratified according to baseline proteinuria (<2 or ≥2 g/24 h), baseline eGFR (<60 or ≥60 mL/min per 1·73 m2), and region (Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America, or South America). Patients, investigators, and site staff were masked to treatment assignment throughout the 2-year trial. Optimised supportive care was also continued throughout the trial. The primary efficacy endpoint was time-weighted average of eGFR over 2 years. Efficacy and safety analyses were done in the full analysis set (ie, all randomly assigned patients). The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT03643965, and is completed.Findings:Patients were recruited to the NefIgArd trial between Sept 5, 2018, and Jan 20, 2021, with 364 patients (182 per treatment group) randomly assigned in the full analysis set. 240 (66%) patients were men and 124 (34%) were women, and 275 (76%) identified as White. The time-weighted average of eGFR over 2 years showed a statistically significant treatment benefit with Nefecon versus placebo (difference 5·05 mL/min per 1·73 m2[95% CI 3·24 to 7·38], p<0·0001), with a time-weighted average change of -2·47 mL/min per 1·73 m2(95% CI -3·88 to -1·02) reported with Nefecon and -7·52 mL/min per 1·73 m2(-8·83 to -6·18) reported with placebo. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events during treatment with Nefecon were peripheral oedema (31 [17%] patients, vs placebo, seven [4%] patients), hypertension (22 [12%] vs six [3%]), muscle spasms (22 [12%] vs seven [4%]), acne (20 [11%] vs two [1%]), and headache (19 [10%] vs 14 [8%]). No treatment-related deaths were reported.Interpretation:A 9-month treatment period with Nefecon provided a clinically relevant reduction in eGFR decline and a durable reduction in proteinuria versus placebo, providing support for a disease-modifying effect in patients with IgA nephropathy. Nefecon was also well tolerated, with a safety profile as expected for a locally acting oral budesonide product.Funding:Calliditas Therapeutics."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36623234,"Background:Personalized body-worn alcohol dispensers may serve as an important tool for perioperative infection control, but the impact of these devices on the epidemiology of transmission of high-risk Enterococcus , Staphylococcus aureus , Klebsiella, Acinetobacter , Pseudomonas , and Enterobacter (ESKAPE) pathogens is unknown. We aimed to characterize the epidemiology of ESKAPE transmission in the pediatric anesthesia work area environment with and without a personalized body-worn alcohol dispenser.Methods:This controlled before and after study included 40 pediatric patients enrolled over a 1-year study period. Two groups of operating room cases were compared: (1) operating room cases caring for patients with usual care (December 17, 2019, to August 25, 2020), and (2) operating room cases caring for patients with usual care plus the addition of a personalized, body-worn alcohol hand rub dispenser (September 30, 2020, to December 16, 2020). Operating rooms were randomly selected for observation of ESKAPE transmission in both groups. Device use was tracked via wireless technology and recorded in hourly hand decontamination events.Results:Anesthesia providers used the alcohol dispenser 3.3 ± 2.1 times per hour. A total of 57 ESKAPE transmission events (29 treatment and 28 control) were identified. The personalized body-worn alcohol dispenser impacted ESKAPE transmission by increasing the contribution of provider hand contamination at case start (21/29 device versus 10/28 usual care; relative risk, [RR] 2.03; 99.17% confidence interval [CI], 1.025-5.27; P = .0066) and decreasing the contribution of environmental contamination at case end (3/29 device versus 12/28 usual care; RR, 0.24; 99.17% CI, 0.022-0.947; P = .0059). ESKAPE pathogen contamination involved 20% (8/40) of patient intravascular devices. There were 85% (34/40) of preoperative patient skin surfaces contaminated with ≥1 (1.78 ± 0.19 [standard deviation {SD}]) ESKAPE pathogens.Conclusions:A personalized body-worn alcohol dispenser can impact the epidemiology of ESKAPE transmission in the pediatric anesthesia work area environment. Improved preoperative patient decolonization and vascular care are indicated to address ESKAPE pathogens among pediatric anesthesia work area reservoirs."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38297916,"Background:Novel treatments are needed for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, particularly for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Exebacase is a first-in-class antistaphylococcal lysin that is rapidly bactericidal and synergizes with antibiotics.Methods:In Direct Lysis of Staph Aureus Resistant Pathogen Trial of Exebacase (DISRUPT), a superiority-design phase 3 study, patients with S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of intravenous exebacase or placebo in addition to standard-of-care antibiotics. The primary efficacy outcome was clinical response at day 14 in the MRSA population.Results:A total of 259 patients were randomized before the study was stopped for futility based on the recommendation of the unblinded Data Safety Monitoring Board. Clinical response rates at day 14 in the MRSA population (n = 97) were 50.0% (exebacase + antibiotics; 32/64) versus 60.6% (antibiotics alone; 20/33) (P = .392). Overall, rates of adverse events were similar across groups. No adverse events of hypersensitivity related to exebacase were reported.Conclusions:Exebacase + antibiotics failed to improve clinical response at day 14 in patients with MRSA bacteremia/endocarditis. This result was unexpected based on phase 2 data that established proof-of-concept for exebacase + antibiotics in patients with MRSA bacteremia/endocarditis. In the antibiotics-alone group, the clinical response rate was higher than that seen in phase 2. Heterogeneity within the study population and a relatively small sample size in either the phase 2 or phase 3 studies may have increased the probability of imbalances in the multiple components of day 14 clinical outcome. This study provides lessons for future superiority studies in S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis. Clinical Trials Registration.NCT04160468."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38295131,"Background:Large neck circumference and displacement of the trachea due to pathology increase the risk of failed identification of the cricothyroid membrane and cricothyroidotomy. We investigated whether ultrasound aids in the successful identification of the cricothyroid membrane in a model of an obese neck with midline deviation of the trachea.Methods:We developed silicone neck models that were suitable for both palpation and ultrasonography and where the trachea deviated laterally from the midline to either side. After reading a book chapter and participating in a 25-minute lecture and a 15- to 23-minute hands-on demonstration and rehearsal of ultrasonography for identification of the cricothyroid membrane, anesthesiologists and anesthesiology residents randomly performed identification with either ultrasound or palpation on 1 of 2 neck models.Results:We included 57 participants, of whom 29 and 28 were randomized to palpation and ultrasound, respectively. Correct identification of the cricothyroid membrane was achieved by 21 (75.0%) vs 1 (3.5%) of participants in the ultrasound versus palpation groups (risk ratio [RR], 21.8 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 3.1-151.0]). The tracheal midline position in the sagittal plane was identified correctly by 24 (85.7%) vs 16 (55.2%) of participants in the ultrasound versus palpation groups (RR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.2]).Conclusions:Identification of the cricothyroid membrane in a model of an obese neck with midline deviation of the trachea was more often successful with ultrasound compared to palpation. Our study supports the potential use of ultrasound before induction of anesthesia and airway management in this group of patients, and it may even be applied in emergency situations when ultrasound is readily available.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38291297,"Cesarean section rates worldwide are rising, driven by medically unnecessary cesarean use. The new World Health Organization Labour Care Guide (LCG) aims to improve the quality of care for women during labor and childbirth. Using the LCG might reduce overuse of cesarean; however, its effects have not been evaluated in randomized trials. We conducted a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized pilot trial in four hospitals in India to evaluate the implementation of an LCG strategy intervention, compared with routine care. We performed this trial to pilot the intervention and obtain preliminary effectiveness data, informing future research. Eligible clusters were four hospitals with >4,000 births annually and cesarean rates ≥30%. Eligible women were those giving birth at ≥20 weeks' gestation. One hospital transitioned to intervention every 2 months, according to a random sequence. The primary outcome was the cesarean rate among women in Robson Group 1 (that is, those who were nulliparous and gave birth to a singleton, term pregnancy in cephalic presentation and in spontaneous labor). A total of 26,331 participants gave birth. A 5.5% crude absolute reduction in the primary outcome was observed (45.2% versus 39.7%; relative risk 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.54-1.33). Maternal process-of-care outcomes were not significantly different, though labor augmentation with oxytocin was 18.0% lower with the LCG strategy. No differences were observed for other health outcomes or women's birth experiences. These findings can guide future definitive effectiveness trials, particularly in settings where urgent reversal of rising cesarean section rates is needed.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38267108,"Background:Endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) and phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE5i) combination therapy is recommended for low-/intermediate-risk pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients. A fixed-dose combination of the ERA macitentan and PDE5i tadalafil (M/T FDC) in a once-daily, single tablet would simplify treatment.Objectives:The multicenter, double-blind, adaptive phase 3 A DUE study investigated the efficacy and safety of M/T FDC vs macitentan 10 mg and vs tadalafil 40 mg monotherapies in PAH patients, including treatment-naïve and prior ERA or PDE5i monotherapy-treated patients.Methods:World Health Organization functional class II-III patients were randomized to M/T FDC, macitentan, or tadalafil depending on their PAH treatment (treatment-naïve, ERA, or PDE5i monotherapy) at baseline. The primary endpoint was change in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) at week 16.Results:In total, 187 patients were randomized to single-tablet M/T FDC (n = 108), macitentan (n = 35), or tadalafil (n = 44). PVR reduction with M/T FDC was significantly greater vs macitentan (29%; geometric mean ratio 0.71; 95% CL: 0.61-0.82; P < 0.0001) and vs tadalafil (28%; geometric mean ratio 0.72; 95% CL: 0.64-0.80; P < 0.0001). Three patients died in the M/T FDC arm (judged unrelated to treatment). Adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation, serious AEs, and those of special interest (anemia, hypotension, and edema) were more frequent with M/T FDC.Conclusions:Macitentan and tadalafil FDC significantly improved PVR vs monotherapies in PAH patients, with a safety and tolerability profile consistent with the individual components.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38261535,"Significance statement:Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of CKD and is associated with more rapid decline of kidney function, but well-powered controlled randomized trials testing the effect of treating metabolic acidosis on slowing CKD progression have not been conducted. The VALOR-CKD study randomized 1480 individuals with CKD and metabolic acidosis, across 320 sites to placebo or veverimer (a novel hydrochloric acid binder). The findings did not demonstrate the efficacy of veverimer in slowing CKD progression, but the difference in serum bicarbonate between placebo and drug arms was only approximately 1 mEq/L. Veverimer was safe and well tolerated.Background:Metabolic acidosis is common in CKD, but whether its treatment slows CKD progression is unknown. Veverimer, a novel hydrochloric acid binder that removes acid from the gastrointestinal tract, leads to an increase in serum bicarbonate.Methods:In a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with CKD (eGFR of 20-40 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 ) and metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate of 12-20 mEq/L) from 35 countries were randomized to veverimer or placebo. The primary outcome was the composite end point of CKD progression, defined as the development of ESKD (kidney transplantation or maintenance dialysis), a sustained decline in eGFR of ≥40% from baseline, or death due to kidney failure.Results:The mean (±SD) baseline eGFR was 29.2±6.3 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 , and serum bicarbonate was 17.5±1.4 mEq/L; this increased to 23.4±2.0 mEq/L after the active treatment run-in. After randomized withdrawal, the mean serum bicarbonate was 22.0±3.0 mEq/L and 20.9±3.3 mEq/L in the veverimer and placebo groups at month 3, and this approximately 1 mEq/L difference remained stable for the first 24 months. A primary end point event occurred in 149/741 and 148/739 patients in the veverimer and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.8 to 1.2; P = 0.90). Serious and overall adverse event incidence did not differ between the groups.Conclusions:Among patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis, treatment with veverimer did not slow CKD progression.

Eligible average-risk subjects (45 years or older) undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopy were randomized to undergo either CAD-EYE-assisted colonoscopy (CAC) or conventional colonoscopy (CC). Modified intention-to-treat analysis was performed for all patients who completed colonoscopy with the primary outcome of APC. Secondary outcomes included positive predictive value (total number of adenomas divided by total polyps removed) and adenoma detection rate.Results:In modified intention-to-treat analysis, of 1,031 subjects (age: 59.1 ± 9.8 years; 49.9% male), 510 underwent CAC vs 523 underwent CC with no significant differences in age, gender, ethnicity, or colonoscopy indication between the 2 groups. CAC led to a significantly higher APC compared with CC: 0.99 ± 1.6 vs 0.85 ± 1.5, P = 0.02, incidence rate ratio 1.17 (1.03-1.33, P = 0.02) with no significant difference in the withdrawal time: 11.28 ± 4.59 minutes vs 10.8 ± 4.81 minutes; P = 0.11 between the 2 groups. Difference in positive predictive value of a polyp being an adenoma among CAC and CC was less than 10% threshold established: 48.6% vs 54%, 95% CI -9.56% to -1.48%. There were no significant differences in adenoma detection rate (46.9% vs 42.8%), advanced adenoma (6.5% vs 6.3%), sessile serrated lesion detection rate (12.9% vs 10.1%), and polyp detection rate (63.9% vs 59.3%) between the 2 groups.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38231622,"Background:The Resynchronization-Defibrillation for Ambulatory Heart Failure Trial (RAFT) showed a greater benefit with respect to mortality at 5 years among patients who received cardiac-resynchronization therapy (CRT) than among those who received implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). However, the effect of CRT on long-term survival is not known.Methods:We randomly assigned patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% or less, and an intrinsic QRS duration of 120 msec or more (or a paced QRS duration of 200 msec or more) to receive either an ICD alone or a CRT defibrillator (CRT-D). We assessed long-term outcomes among patients at the eight highest-enrolling participating sites. The primary outcome was death from any cause; the secondary outcome was a composite of death from any cause, heart transplantation, or implantation of a ventricular assist device.Results:The trial enrolled 1798 patients, of whom 1050 were included in the long-term survival trial; the median duration of follow-up for the 1050 patients was 7.7 years (interquartile range, 3.9 to 12.8), and the median duration of follow-up for those who survived was 13.9 years (interquartile range, 12.8 to 15.7). Death occurred in 405 of 530 patients (76.4%) assigned to the ICD group and in 370 of 520 patients (71.2%) assigned to the CRT-D group. The time until death appeared to be longer for those assigned to receive a CRT-D than for those assigned to receive an ICD (acceleration factor, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.69 to 0.92; P = 0.002). A secondary-outcome event occurred in 412 patients (77.7%) in the ICD group and in 392 (75.4%) in the CRT-D group.Conclusions:Among patients with a reduced ejection fraction, a widened QRS complex, and NYHA class II or III heart failure, the survival benefit associated with receipt of a CRT-D as compared with ICD appeared to be sustained during a median of nearly 14 years of follow-up.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38231621,"Background:Testosterone treatment in men with hypogonadism improves bone density and quality, but trials with a sufficiently large sample and a sufficiently long duration to determine the effect of testosterone on the incidence of fractures are needed.Methods:In a subtrial of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that assessed the cardiovascular safety of testosterone treatment in middle-aged and older men with hypogonadism, we examined the risk of clinical fracture in a time-to-event analysis. Eligible men were 45 to 80 years of age with preexisting, or high risk of, cardiovascular disease; one or more symptoms of hypogonadism; and two morning testosterone concentrations of less than 300 ng per deciliter (10.4 nmol per liter), in fasting plasma samples obtained at least 48 hours apart. Participants were randomly assigned to apply a testosterone or placebo gel daily. At every visit, participants were asked if they had had a fracture since the previous visit. If they had, medical records were obtained and adjudicated.Results:The full-analysis population included 5204 participants (2601 in the testosterone group and 2603 in the placebo group). After a median follow-up of 3.19 years, a clinical fracture had occurred in 91 participants (3.50%) in the testosterone group and 64 participants (2.46%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.97). The fracture incidence also appeared to be higher in the testosterone group for all other fracture end points.Conclusions:Among middle-aged and older men with hypogonadism, testosterone treatment did not result in a lower incidence of clinical fracture than placebo. The fracture incidence was numerically higher among men who received testosterone than among those who received placebo.

The effects of bempedoic acid on total cardiovascular events remain unknown.Objective:To determine the impact of bempedoic acid on the total incidence of MACE.Design, setting, and participants:Included in this prespecified analysis of the Cholesterol Lowering via Bempedoic Acid, an ACL-Inhibiting Regimen (CLEAR) Outcomes trial were patients with, or at high risk for, cardiovascular disease, with hypercholesterolemia and inability to take guideline-recommended statins. Study data were analyzed from December 2016 to November 2022.Interventions:Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with bempedoic acid or placebo daily.Main outcomes and measures:The primary end point was the time to first event for a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or coronary revascularization (MACE-4). The key secondary end point was time to first event for cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke (MACE-3). This prespecified analysis compared the total number of cardiovascular events in the treatment groups.Results:A total of 13 970 patients (mean [SD] age, 65 [9] years; 7230 male [51.8%]) were included in the study. A total of 9764 participants (69.9%) had prior atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and a baseline LDL-C level of 139 mg/dL; treatment with bempedoic acid resulted in a 21% reduction in LDL-C level and a 22% reduction in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level at 6 months. Median (IQR) follow-up was 3.4 (3.1-3.9) years. A total of 1746 positively adjudicated first MACE-4 events and 915 additional MACE events in 612 patients were recorded, with coronary revascularization representing 32.8% (573 of 1746) of first events and 69.4% (635 of 915) of additional events. For the total incidence of cardiovascular events, treatment with bempedoic acid was associated with a reduction in risk of MACE-4 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72-0.89; P <.001), MACE-3 (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73-0.93; P = .002), myocardial infarction (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.58-0.83; P < .001), and coronary revascularization (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68-0.89; P <.001), although no statistically significant difference was observed for stroke (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.63-1.03). A lower HR for protection with bempedoic acid was observed with increasing number of MACE events experienced by patients.Conclusion and relevance:Lowering LDL-C level with bempedoic acid reduced the total number of cardiovascular events in patients with high cardiovascular risk, statin therapy intolerance, and elevated LDL-C levels."

We tested its efficacy in reducing the primary outcome depression symptoms measured by the GRID Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item over 8, 16 and 26 weeks, compared with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) neuronavigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered at the standard stimulation site (F3) in patients with 'treatment-resistant depression'. Participants were randomly assigned to 20 sessions over 4-6 weeks of either cgiTBS (n = 128) or rTMS (n = 127) with resting-state functional MRI at baseline and 16 weeks. Persistent decreases in depressive symptoms were seen over 26 weeks, with no differences between arms on the primary outcome GRID Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item score (intention-to-treat adjusted mean, -0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.87, 1.24, P = 0.689).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38228913,"Exergame training, in which video games are used to promote exercise, can be tailored to address cognitive and physical risk factors for falls and is a promising method for fall prevention in older people. Here, we performed a randomized clinical trial using the smart±step gaming system to examine the effectiveness of two home-based computer game interventions, seated cognitive training and step exergame training, for fall prevention in community-dwelling older people, as compared with a minimal-intervention control group. Participants aged 65 years or older (n = 769, 71% female) living independently in the community were randomized to one of three arms: (1) cognitive training using a computerized touchpad while seated, (2) exergame step training on a computerized mat or (3) control (provided with an education booklet on healthy ageing and fall prevention). The rate of falls reported monthly over 12 months-the primary outcome of the trial-was significantly reduced in the exergame training group compared with the control group (incidence rate ratio = 0.74, 95% confidence interval = 0.56-0.98), but was not statistically different between the cognitive training and control groups (incidence rate ratio = 0.86, 95% confidence interval = 0.65-1.12). No beneficial effects of the interventions were found for secondary outcomes of physical and cognitive function, and no serious intervention-related adverse events were reported. The results of this trial support the use of exergame step training for preventing falls in community-dwelling older people. As this intervention can be conducted at home and requires only minimal equipment, it has the potential for scalability as a public health intervention to address the increasing problem of falls and fall-related injuries.

Outpatients with COPD, HF, or ILD at high risk of hospitalization or death who reported poor quality of life participated.Intervention:The intervention involved 6 phone calls with a nurse to help with symptom management and 6 phone calls with a social worker to provide psychosocial care. The nurse and social worker met weekly with a study primary care and palliative care physician and as needed, a pulmonologist, and cardiologist. Usual care included an educational handout developed for the study that outlined self-care for COPD, ILD, or HF. Patients in both groups received care at the discretion of their clinicians, which could include care from nurses and social workers, and specialists in cardiology, pulmonology, palliative care, and mental health.Main outcomes and measures:The primary outcome was difference in change in quality of life from baseline to 6 months between the intervention and usual care groups (FACT-G score range, 0-100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life, clinically meaningful change ≥4 points). Secondary quality-of-life outcomes at 6 months included disease-specific health status (Clinical COPD Questionnaire; Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-12), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) symptoms.Results:Among 306 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 68.9 [7.7] years; 276 male [90.2%], 30 female [9.8%]; 245 White [80.1%]), 177 (57.8%) had COPD, 67 (21.9%) HF, 49 (16%) both COPD and HF, and 13 (4.2%) ILD.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38224710,"Background:The efficacy of daily co-trimoxazole, an antifolate used for malaria chemoprevention in pregnant women living with HIV, is threatened by cross-resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to the antifolate sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. We assessed whether addition of monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine to daily co-trimoxazole is more effective at preventing malaria infection than monthly placebo plus daily co-trimoxazole in pregnant women living with HIV.Methods:We did an individually randomised, two-arm, placebo-controlled trial in areas with high-grade sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance in Kenya and Malawi. Pregnant women living with HIV on dolutegravir-based combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) who had singleton pregnancies between 16 weeks' and 28 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned (1:1) by computer-generated block randomisation, stratified by site and HIV status (known positive vs newly diagnosed), to daily co-trimoxazole plus monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (three tablets of 40 mg dihydroartemisinin and 320 mg piperaquine given daily for 3 days) or daily co-trimoxazole plus monthly placebo. Daily co-trimoxazole consisted of one tablet of 160 mg sulfamethoxazole and 800 mg trimethoprim. The primary endpoint was the incidence of Plasmodium infection detected in the peripheral (maternal) or placental (maternal) blood or tissue by PCR, microscopy, rapid diagnostic test, or placental histology (active infection) from 2 weeks after the first dose of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine or placebo to delivery. Log-binomial regression was used for binary outcomes, and Poisson regression for count outcomes. The primary analysis was by modified intention to treat, consisting of all randomised eligible participants with primary endpoint data. The safety analysis included all women who received at least one dose of study drug. All investigators, laboratory staff, data analysts, and participants were masked to treatment assignment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT04158713.Findings:From Nov 11, 2019, to Aug 3, 2021, 904 women were enrolled and randomly assigned to co-trimoxazole plus dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (n=448) or co-trimoxazole plus placebo (n=456), of whom 895 (99%) contributed to the primary analysis (co-trimoxazole plus dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, n=443; co-trimoxazole plus placebo, n=452). The cumulative risk of any malaria infection during pregnancy or delivery was lower in the co-trimoxazole plus dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group than in the co-trimoxazole plus placebo group (31 [7%] of 443 women vs 70 [15%] of 452 women, risk ratio 0·45, 95% CI 0·30-0·67; p=0·0001). The incidence of any malaria infection during pregnancy or delivery was 25·4 per 100 person-years in the co-trimoxazole plus dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group versus 77·3 per 100 person-years in the co-trimoxazole plus placebo group (incidence rate ratio 0·32, 95% CI 0·22-0·47, p<0·0001). The number needed to treat to avert one malaria infection per pregnancy was 7 (95% CI 5-10). The incidence of serious adverse events was similar between groups in mothers (17·7 per 100 person-years in the co-trimoxazole plus dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group [23 events] vs 17·8 per 100 person-years in the co-trimoxazole group [25 events]) and infants (45·4 per 100 person-years [23 events] vs 40·2 per 100 person-years [21 events]). Nausea within the first 4 days after the start of treatment was reported by 29 (7%) of 446 women in the co-trimoxazole plus dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine group versus 12 (3%) of 445 women in the co-trimoxazole plus placebo group. The risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes did not differ between groups.Interpretation:Addition of monthly intermittent preventive treatment with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine to the standard of care with daily unsupervised co-trimoxazole in areas of high antifolate resistance substantially improves malaria chemoprevention in pregnant women living with HIV on dolutegravir-based cART and should be considered for policy.Funding:European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership 2; UK Joint Global Health Trials Scheme (UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office; Medical Research Council; National Institute for Health Research; Wellcome); and Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency."

The complexity of the dosing scheme, however, has led to implementation barriers.Methods:We conducted two independent randomized trials of calcium supplementation, in India and Tanzania, to assess the noninferiority of a 500-mg daily dose to a 1500-mg daily dose of calcium supplementation. In each trial, the two primary outcomes were preeclampsia and preterm birth, and the noninferiority margins for the relative risks were 1.54 and 1.16, respectively.Results:A total of 11,000 nulliparous pregnant women were included in each trial. The cumulative incidence of preeclampsia was 3.0% in the 500-mg group and 3.6% in the 1500-mg group in the India trial (relative risk, 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 1.03) and 3.0% and 2.7%, respectively, in the Tanzania trial (relative risk, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.36) - findings consistent with the noninferiority of the lower dose in both trials. The percentage of live births that were preterm was 11.4% in the 500-mg group and 12.8% in the 1500-mg group in the India trial (relative risk, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.98), which was within the noninferiority margin of 1.16; in the Tanzania trial, the respective percentages were 10.4% and 9.7% (relative risk, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.21), which exceeded the noninferiority margin.Conclusions:In these two trials, low-dose calcium supplementation was noninferior to high-dose calcium supplementation with respect to the risk of preeclampsia.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38190339,"Background:Optimal analgesic protocols for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients remain controversial. Multimodal analgesia is advocated, often including peripheral nerve blocks and/or periarticular injections (PAIs). If 2 blocks (adductor canal block [ACB] plus infiltration between the popliteal artery and capsule of the knee [IPACK]) are used, also performing PAI may not be necessary. This noninferiority trial hypothesized that TKA patients with ACB + IPACK + saline PAI (sham infiltration) would have pain scores that were no worse than those of patients with ACB + IPACK + active PAI with local anesthetic.Methods:A multimodal analgesic protocol of spinal anesthesia, ACB and IPACK blocks, intraoperative ketamine and ketorolac, postoperative ketorolac followed by meloxicam, acetaminophen, duloxetine, and oral opioids was used. Patients undergoing primary unilateral TKA were randomized to receive either active PAI or control PAI. The active PAI included a deep injection, performed before cementation, of bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine, 30 mL; morphine; methylprednisolone; cefazolin; with normal saline to bring total volume to 64 mL. A superficial injection of 20 mL bupivacaine, 0.25%, was administered before closure. Control injections were normal saline injected with the same injection technique and volumes. The primary outcome was numeric rating scale pain with ambulation on postoperative day 1. A noninferiority margin of 1.0 was used.Results:Ninety-four patients were randomized. NRS pain with ambulation at POD1 in the ACB + IPACK + saline PAI group was not found to be noninferior to that of the ACB + IPACK + active PAI group (difference = 0.3, 95% confidence interval [CI], [-0.9 to 1.5], P = .120). Pain scores at rest did not differ significantly among groups. No significant difference was observed in opioid consumption between groups. Cumulative oral morphine equivalents through postoperative day 2 were 89 ± 40 mg (mean ± standard deviation), saline PAI, vs 73 ± 52, active PAI, P = .1. No significant differences were observed for worst pain, fraction of time in severe pain, pain interference, side-effects (nausea, drowsiness, itching, dizziness), quality of recovery, satisfaction, length of stay, chronic pain, and orthopedic outcomes.Conclusions:For TKA patients given a comprehensive analgesic protocol, use of saline PAI did not demonstrate noninferiority compared to active PAI. Neither the primary nor any secondary outcomes demonstrated superiority for active PAI, however. As we cannot claim either technique to be better or worse, there remains flexibility for use of either technique."

Anesthesiology trainees (residents and fellows) placed thoracic epidural catheters under faculty supervision and rescue. The primary outcome was the success rate of thoracic epidural catheter placement, evaluated by the loss of cold sensation in the thoracic dermatomes 20 minutes after injecting the epidural test dose. Secondary outcomes included procedural time, ease of catheter placement, the presence of a positive falling meniscus sign, early hemodynamic changes, and unintended dural punctures. Additionally, we explored outcomes that included number of attempts, needle depth to epidural space, need for faculty to rescue the procedure from the trainee, patient-rated procedural discomfort, pain at the epidural insertion site, postoperative pain scores, and opioid consumption over 48 hours.Results:Between March 2019 and June 2020, 133 patients were enrolled; 117 were included in the final analysis (n = 57 for the LOR group; n = 60 for the DPS group). The primary success rate of epidural catheter placement was 91.2% (52 of 57) in the LOR group and 96.7% (58 of 60) in the DPS group (95% confidence interval [CI] of difference in proportions: -0.054 [-0.14 to 0.03]; P = .264). No difference was observed in procedural time between the 2 groups (median interquartile range [IQR] in minutes: LOR 5.0 [7.0], DPS 5.5 [7.0]; P = .982). The number of patients with epidural analgesia onset at 10 minutes was 49.1% (28 of 57) in the LOR group compared to 31.7% (19 of 60) in the DPS group ( P = .062). There were 2 cases of unintended dural punctures in each group. Other secondary or exploratory outcomes were not significantly different between the groups.Conclusions:Our trial did not establish the superiority of the DPS technique over the traditional LOR method for identifying the thoracic epidural space ( Clinicaltrials.gov identifier:NCT03826186)."

In this phase 3, open-label, randomized study, we evaluated the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of the AS01E-adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein-based candidate vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) when co-administered with a seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccine (FLU-QIV) in older adults.Methods:Participants aged ≥60 years (randomized 1:1) received either RSVPreF3 OA and FLU-QIV simultaneously on day 1 (Co-Ad group) or FLU-QIV on day 1 followed by RSVPreF3 OA on day 31 (sequential administration [SA] group). The co-primary objectives were to demonstrate noninferiority of RSVPreF3 OA in terms of RSV-A neutralization geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio and FLU-QIV in terms of hemagglutination inhibition GMT ratio for each FLU-QIV strain, when co-administered versus when administered alone at 1-month post-vaccination. Noninferiority was demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interview of the group GMT ratio (SA/Co-Ad) was ≤1.5. Secondary descriptive objectives comprised additional immunogenicity assessments, reactogenicity, and safety.Results:Of the 885 participants who received one dose of the study vaccines, 837 were included in the per protocol set. Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between the groups. Both co-primary objectives were met for both vaccines. Reported adverse events in both groups were mild-to-moderate, with a low frequency of grade 3 events.Conclusions:Data from this study demonstrate that RSVPreF3 OA can be co-administered with FLU-QIV. Co-administration is well tolerated, with an acceptable safety profile.Clinicaltrials.gov registration:NCT04841577."

Here we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the antimalarial combination artesunate-mefloquine for the treatment of schistosomiasis in a proof-of-concept, pragmatic, open-label, randomized controlled trial in primary schools of six villages endemic for schistosomiasis in northern Senegal. Children (6-14 years) were eligible if Schistosoma eggs were detected by microscopy in urine and/or stool. In total, 726 children were randomized 1:1 to praziquantel (standard care: 40 mg kg-1single dose; n = 364) or to artesunate-mefloquine (antimalarial dosage: artesunate 4 mg kg-1and mefloquine 8 mg kg-1daily for three consecutive days; n = 362). Eight children not meeting the inclusion criteria were excluded from efficacy analysis. Median age of the remaining 718 participants was 9 years; 399 (55.6%) were male, and 319 (44.4%) female; 99.3% were infected with Schistosoma haematobium and 15.2% with S. mansoni. Primary outcomes were cure rate, assessed by microscopy, and frequency of drug-related adverse effects of artesunate-mefloquine versus praziquantel at 4 weeks after treatment. Cure rate was 59.6% (208/349) in the artesunate-mefloquine arm versus 62.1% (211/340) in the praziquantel arm. The difference of -2.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) -9.8 to 4.8) met the predefined criteria of noninferiority (margin set at 10%). All drug-related adverse events were mild or moderate, and reported in 28/361 children receiving artesunate-mefloquine (7.8%; 95% CI 5.4 to 11.0) versus 8/363 (2.2%; 95% CI 1.1 to 4.3) receiving praziquantel (P < 0.001). Artesunate-mefloquine at antimalarial dosage was moderately safe and noninferior to standard-care praziquantel for the treatment of schistosomiasis, predominantly due to S. haematobium. Multicentric trials in different populations and epidemiological settings are needed to confirm these findings. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:NCT03893097."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38170601,"Significance statement:In CKD, metabolic acidosis is commonly treated with alkali in the hope that it will improve bone health. In a post hoc analysis of the Bicarbonate Administration to Stabilize eGFR Pilot Trial, we investigated whether sodium bicarbonate affects serum levels of bone turnover markers and other hormones related to bone health in individuals with CKD who have normal to slightly reduced total CO2 (20-28 mEq/L). Sodium bicarbonate increased serum levels of α-klotho but had no significant effect on other bone health markers, including intact fibroblast growth factor-23 (iFGF-23), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (B-SAP). Further study is needed to determine the effect of bicarbonate administration on clinical aspects of bone health.Background:Treatment with alkali has been hypothesized to improve bone health in CKD by mitigating adverse effects of acid on bone mineral. We investigated the effect of treatment with sodium bicarbonate on bone turnover markers and other factors related to bone metabolism in CKD.Methods:This is a post hoc analysis of the Bicarbonate Administration to Stabilize eGFR Pilot Trial in which 194 individuals with CKD and serum total CO2 20-28 mEq/L were randomly assigned to placebo or one of two doses of sodium bicarbonate (0.5 or 0.8 mEq/kg lean body weight per day) for 28 weeks. The following serum measurements were performed at baseline, week 12, and week 28: B-SAP, c-telopeptide, procollagen type I intact N-terminal propeptide, iPTH, iFGF-23, soluble klotho, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b. The difference (sodium bicarbonate versus placebo) in mean change of each bone biomarker from baseline was determined using linear mixed models.Results:One hundred sixty-eight participants submitted samples for post hoc investigations. Mean eGFR was 37±10 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and mean total CO2 was 24±3 mEq/L at baseline. Sodium bicarbonate induced a dose-dependent increase in soluble klotho levels compared with placebo. There was no significant effect of treatment with either dose of sodium bicarbonate on any of the other bone biomarkers, including iFGF-23, iPTH, and B-SAP. Effects on bone biomarkers were similar in those with baseline serum total CO2 <24 mEq/L compared with those with total CO2 ≥24 mEq/L.Conclusions:In this pilot trial of individuals with CKD and total CO2 20-28 mEq/L, sodium bicarbonate treatment increased serum klotho levels but did not affect other bone health markers over 28 weeks.Clinical trial registry name and registration number:ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT02521181."

Whether the replacement of biomass fuel (e.g., wood, dung, or agricultural crop waste) with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking can reduce the risk of stunting is unknown.Methods:We conducted a randomized trial involving 3200 pregnant women 18 to 34 years of age in four low- and middle-income countries. Women at 9 to less than 20 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to use a free LPG cookstove with continuous free fuel delivery for 18 months (intervention group) or to continue using a biomass cookstove (control group). The length of each infant was measured at 12 months of age, and personal exposures to fine particulate matter (particles with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 μm) were monitored starting at pregnancy and continuing until the infants were 1 year of age. The primary outcome for which data are presented in the current report - stunting (defined as a length-for-age z score that was more than two standard deviations below the median of a growth standard) at 12 months of age - was one of four primary outcomes of the trial. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed to estimate the relative risk of stunting.Results:Adherence to the intervention was high, and the intervention resulted in lower prenatal and postnatal 24-hour personal exposures to fine particulate matter than the control (mean prenatal exposure, 35.0 μg per cubic meter vs. 103.3 μg per cubic meter; mean postnatal exposure, 37.9 μg per cubic meter vs. 109.2 μg per cubic meter). Among 3061 live births, 1171 (76.2%) of the 1536 infants born to women in the intervention group and 1186 (77.8%) of the 1525 infants born to women in the control group had a valid length measurement at 12 months of age. Stunting occurred in 321 of the 1171 infants included in the analysis (27.4%) of the infants born to women in the intervention group and in 299 of the 1186 infants included in the analysis (25.2%) of those born to women in the control group (relative risk, 1.10; 98.75% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.29; P = 0.12).Conclusions:An intervention strategy starting in pregnancy and aimed at mitigating household air pollution by replacing biomass fuel with LPG for cooking did not reduce the risk of stunting in infants.

The effect of replacing biomass cookstoves with liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cookstoves on the incidence of severe infant pneumonia is uncertain.Methods:We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving pregnant women 18 to 34 years of age and between 9 to less than 20 weeks' gestation in India, Guatemala, Peru, and Rwanda from May 2018 through September 2021. The women were assigned to cook with unvented LPG stoves and fuel (intervention group) or to continue cooking with biomass fuel (control group). In each trial group, we monitored adherence to the use of the assigned cookstove and measured 24-hour personal exposure to fine particulate matter (particles with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 μm [PM2.5]) in the women and their offspring. The trial had four primary outcomes; the primary outcome for which data are presented in the current report was severe pneumonia in the first year of life, as identified through facility surveillance or on verbal autopsy.Results:Among 3200 pregnant women who had undergone randomization, 3195 remained eligible and gave birth to 3061 infants (1536 in the intervention group and 1525 in the control group). High uptake of the intervention led to a reduction in personal exposure to PM2.5among the children, with a median exposure of 24.2 μg per cubic meter (interquartile range, 17.8 to 36.4) in the intervention group and 66.0 μg per cubic meter (interquartile range, 35.2 to 132.0) in the control group. A total of 175 episodes of severe pneumonia were identified during the first year of life, with an incidence of 5.67 cases per 100 child-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.55 to 7.07) in the intervention group and 6.06 cases per 100 child-years (95% CI, 4.81 to 7.62) in the control group (incidence rate ratio, 0.96; 98.75% CI, 0.64 to 1.44; P = 0.81).

Participants who became pregnant were randomized to pregnancy and early childhood interventions or routine care. Neurodevelopmental assessments, the trial's secondary outcome reported herein, were conducted in a subsample of children at age 24 months, including 509 with preconception, pregnancy, and early childhood interventions; 473 with preconception interventions alone; 380 with pregnancy and early childhood interventions alone; and 350 with routine care. This study was conducted from November 1, 2000, through February 25, 2022.Interventions:Health, nutrition, psychosocial care and support, and WASH interventions delivered during preconception, pregnancy, and early childhood periods.Main outcomes and measures:Cognitive, motor, language, and socioemotional performance at age 24 months, assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development 3 tool.Results:The mean age of participants at enrollment was 23.8 years (SD, 3.0 years). Compared with the controls at age 24 months, children in the preconception intervention groups had higher cognitive scores (mean difference [MD], 1.16; 98.3% CI, 0.18-2.13) but had similar language, motor, and socioemotional scores as controls.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38131615,"Introduction:Intravenous corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment of patients hospitalized with acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC). However, 30%-40% of the patients are refractory to corticosteroids. We investigated whether addition of tofacitinib to corticosteroids improved the treatment responsiveness in patients with ASUC.Methods:This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized adult patients with ASUC (defined by the Truelove Witts severity criteria) to receive either tofacitinib (10 mg thrice daily) or a matching placebo for 7 days while continuing intravenous corticosteroids (hydrocortisone 100 mg every 6 hours). The primary end point was response to treatment (decline in the Lichtiger index by >3 points and an absolute score <10 for 2 consecutive days without the need for rescue therapy) by day 7. The key secondary outcome was the cumulative probability of requiring initiation of infliximab or undergoing colectomy within 90 days following randomization. All analyses were performed in the intention-to-treat population.Results:A total of 104 patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group (53 to tofacitinib and 51 to placebo). At day 7, response to treatment was achieved in 44/53 (83.01%) patients receiving tofacitinib vs 30/51 (58.82%) patients receiving placebo (odds ratio 3.42, 95% confidence interval 1.37-8.48, P = 0.007). The need for rescue therapy by day 7 was lower in the tofacitinib arm (odds ratio 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.09-0.78, P = 0.01). The cumulative probability of need for rescue therapy at day 90 was 0.13 in patients who received tofacitinib vs 0.38 in patients receiving placebo (log-rank P = 0.003). Most of the treatment-related adverse effects were mild. One patient, receiving tofacitinib, developed dural venous sinus thrombosis.Discussion:In patients with ASUC, combination of tofacitinib and corticosteroids improved treatment responsiveness and decreased the need for rescue therapy."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38128556,"Background:Non-randomised studies assessing intrarectal botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA) injections for faecal incontinence are promising. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of BoNTA for the treatment of faecal incontinence in a randomised study.Methods:In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we included adult patients who had at least one urgency or faecal incontinence episode per week for at least 3 months and who had experienced a failure of conservative or surgical treatment from eight French specialist hospital units with the skills to manage patients with faecal incontinence. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a central web form to receive intrarectal submucosal injections of either 200 units of BoNTA (Botox; Allergan, Irvine, CA, USA; BoNTA group) or an equivalent volume of saline (placebo group), stratified by Cleveland Clinic Severity scores (CCS score; ≥12 or <12). Patients, investigators, study site staff, and sponsor personnel were masked to treatment allocation up to the 6-month visit. The primary endpoint was the number of episodes of faecal incontinence and urgency per day assessed using 21-day patient bowel diaries 3 months after the treatment. The primary analysis was performed using a modified intention-to-treat (mITT) approach (ie, in all the randomised patients who had received a treatment) with adjustment for baseline faecal incontinence and urgency episodes. After the final data collection at 6 months after injections, patients were unmasked and offered the BoNTA treatment if they were in the placebo group (rescue therapy) without masking, with an additional 6 months of safety follow-up. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numberNCT02414425.Findings:Between Nov 25, 2015, and Nov 25, 2020, we randomly assigned 200 patients to receive either BoNTA (n=100) or placebo (n=100) injections. Due to withdrawals before the injections, 96 patients were included in the BoNTA group and 95 patients were included in the placebo group (mITT analysis). The mean number of faecal incontinence and urgency episodes per day in the BoNTA group decreased from 1·9 (SD 2·2) at baseline to 0·8 (1·8) at 3 months after the injections, and from 1·4 (1·1) to 1·0 (1·0) in the placebo group, with a baseline-adjusted mean group difference at 3 months estimated at -0·51 (95% CI -0·80 to -0·21, p=0·0008). No serious treatment-related adverse events were reported in the trial. The most frequently reported non-serious adverse event (treatment related or not) following the BoNTA or placebo injections was constipation (reported in 68 [40%] of 169 patients who received the BoNTA injections and 38 [40%] of 95 patients who received placebo injections).Interpretation:BoNTA injections are an efficacious treatment for urge faecal incontinence.

To evaluate the impact of ePOCT+ compared to usual care, we conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial in Tanzanian primary care facilities. Over 11 months, 23,593 consultations were included from 20 ePOCT+ health facilities and 20,713 from 20 usual care facilities. The use of ePOCT+ in intervention facilities resulted in a reduction in the coprimary outcome of antibiotic prescription compared to usual care (23.2% versus 70.1%, adjusted difference -46.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -57.6 to -35.2).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38104575,"Background:New treatments with new mechanisms are urgently needed for people with schizophrenia. Xanomeline is a dual M1and M4-preferring muscarinic receptor agonist that does not block D2dopamine receptors, unlike all currently approved treatments for schizophrenia. Xanomeline-trospium (KarXT) combines xanomeline with the peripherally restricted muscarinic receptor antagonist trospium chloride with the goal of ameliorating xanomeline-related adverse events associated with peripheral muscarinic receptors. The EMERGENT-2 trial aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of KarXT in people with schizophrenia experiencing acute psychosis.Methods:EMERGENT-2 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose, 5-week, inpatient, phase 3 trial in people with schizophrenia. Participants were adults aged 18-65 years with a diagnosis of schizophrenia who had a recent worsening of psychosis warranting hospital admission, a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score of 80 or higher, and a Clinical Global Impression-Severity score of 4 or higher. The participants were recruited from 22 inpatient sites in the USA, and were randomly assigned (1:1) to KarXT or placebo twice per day. Participants randomly assigned to KarXT received 50 mg xanomeline and 20 mg trospium twice per day for the first 2 days and then 100 mg xanomeline and 20 mg trospium twice per day for days 3-7. Beginning on day 8, KarXT dosing was flexible with an optional increase to 125 mg xanomeline and 30 mg trospium twice per day and the option to return to 100 mg xanomeline and 20 mg trospium based on tolerability. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to week 5 in PANSS total score. Efficacy analyses used the modified intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned participants who received at least one trial medication dose and had at least one post-baseline PANSS assessment). Least squares mean change from baseline, SE, and least squares mean difference between the KarXT and placebo groups at week 5, along with the 95% CI and two-sided p values were calculated for the primary and secondary continuous efficacy endpoints. Safety analyses included all participants receiving at least one trial medication dose and used descriptive statistics. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04659161).Findings:From Dec 16, 2020, to April 13, 2022, of 407 people who were screened, 252 participants meeting enrolment criteria were randomly assigned to the KarXT (n=126) or placebo (n=126). Baseline PANSS total scores were 98·3 (KarXT; n=126) and 97·9 (placebo; n=125). The trial met the primary endpoint with a mean change from baseline to week 5 in PANSS total score that favoured KarXT (-21·2 points, SE 1·7) versus placebo (-11·6 points, 1·6; least squares mean difference -9·6; 95% CI -13·9 to -5·2; p<0·0001, Cohen's d effect size=0·61). All secondary endpoints were also met, and favoured KarXT versus placebo (p<0·05). The most common adverse events with KarXT versus placebo were constipation (27 [21%] vs 13 [10%]), dyspepsia (24 [19%] vs 10 [8%]), headache (17 [14%] vs 15 [12%]), nausea (24 [19%] vs seven [6%]), vomiting (18 [14%] vs one [1%]), hypertension (12 [10%] vs one [1%]), dizziness (11 [9%] vs four [3%]), gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (eight [6%] vs zero [0%]), and diarrhoea (seven [6%] vs four [3%]). Treatment-emergent adverse event rates of extrapyramidal motor symptoms (KarXT, zero [0%] vs placebo, zero [0%]), akathisia (one [1%] vs one [1%]), weight gain (zero [0%] vs one [1%]), and somnolence (six [5%] vs five [4%]) were similar between the KarXT and placebo groups, as were adverse event-related discontinuation rates (nine [7%] vs seven [6%]).Interpretation:In the EMERGENT-2 trial, KarXT was effective in reducing positive and negative symptoms and was generally well tolerated. These results support the potential for KarXT to represent a new class of effective and well tolerated antipsychotic medicines based on activating muscarinic receptors, not the D2dopamine receptor-blocking mechanism of all current antipsychotic medications. Results from additional trials, including the identical EMERGENT-3 trial and the 52-week, open-label EMERGENT-4 and EMERGENT-5 trials, will provide additional information on the efficacy and safety of KarXT in people with schizophrenia.Funding:Karuna Therapeutics."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38096892,"Background:Women with a previous caesarean delivery face a difficult choice in their next pregnancy: planning another caesarean or attempting vaginal delivery, both of which are associated with potential maternal and perinatal complications. This trial aimed to assess whether a multifaceted intervention, which promoted person-centred decision making and best practices, would reduce the risk of major perinatal morbidity among women with one previous caesarean delivery.Methods:We conducted an open, multicentre, cluster-randomised, controlled trial of a multifaceted 2-year intervention in 40 hospitals in Quebec among women with one previous caesarean delivery, in which hospitals were the units of randomisation and women the units of analysis. Randomisation was stratified according to level of care, using blocked randomisation. Hospitals were randomly assigned (1:1) to the intervention group (implementation of best practices and provision of tools that aimed to support decision making about mode of delivery, including an estimation of the probability of vaginal delivery and an ultrasound estimation of the risk of uterine rupture), or the control group (no intervention). The primary outcome was a composite risk of major perinatal morbidity.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38084850,"Introduction:This study aimed to compare the accuracy of polyp size measurements using a virtual scale endoscope (VSE) with an integrated laser-based adaptive scale function and visual assessment (VA) during colonoscopies.Methods:We conducted a single-blinded, prospective randomized controlled trial. Eligible patients (aged 45-80 years) undergoing screening, surveillance, or diagnostic colonoscopies were randomly assigned (1:1) into 2 groups. In the intervention group, all detected polyps were measured for size using VSE; in the control group, all polyps were measured using VA. Size measurements were compared with a reference standard of digital caliper measurement immediately post polypectomy. The primary outcome was the relative accuracy of real-time VSE measurement compared with VA. Secondary outcomes included the mean differences and the correlations between VSE or VA sizes and the reference standard of measurement.Results:Overall, 230 patients were enrolled and randomized. The relative size measurement accuracy of VSE was 84% in 118 polyps, which was significantly higher than that of VA (105 polyps; 68.4%, P < 0.001). VSE resulted in a significantly higher percentage of size measurements within 25% of true size compared with VA (81.4% vs 41%, P < 0.001). VSE had a significantly lower percentage for >5-mm polyps incorrectly sized as 1-5 mm compared with VA (13.5% vs 57.1%; P < 0.001) and a significantly lower percentage for >3-mm polyps incorrectly sized as 1-3 mm compared with VA (11.3% vs 56.5%; P < 0.001).Discussion:VSE significantly improves the size measurement accuracy of colorectal polyps during colonoscopies compared with VA and results in fewer misclassifications at relevant decision-making size thresholds."

At week 36, a total of 670 participants were randomized (1:1) to continue receiving tirzepatide (n = 335) or switch to placebo (n = 335) for 52 weeks.Main outcomes and measures:The primary end point was the mean percent change in weight from week 36 (randomization) to week 88. Key secondary end points included the proportion of participants at week 88 who maintained at least 80% of the weight loss during the lead-in period.Results:Participants (n = 670; mean age, 48 years; 473 [71%] women; mean weight, 107.3 kg) who completed the 36-week lead-in period experienced a mean weight reduction of 20.9%. The mean percent weight change from week 36 to week 88 was -5.5% with tirzepatide vs 14.0% with placebo (difference, -19.4% [95% CI, -21.2% to -17.7%]; P < .001). Overall, 300 participants (89.5%) receiving tirzepatide at 88 weeks maintained at least 80% of the weight loss during the lead-in period compared with 16.6% receiving placebo (P < .001). The overall mean weight reduction from week 0 to 88 was 25.3% for tirzepatide and 9.9% for placebo. The most common adverse events were mostly mild to moderate gastrointestinal events, which occurred more commonly with tirzepatide vs placebo.Conclusions and relevance:In participants with obesity or overweight, withdrawing tirzepatide led to substantial regain of lost weight, whereas continued treatment maintained and augmented initial weight reduction.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT04660643."

Dose reductions are recommended in patients responding to biologics, but little supporting safety evidence exists.Methods:SHAMAL was a phase 4, randomised, open-label, active-controlled study done at 22 study sites in four countries. Eligible participants were adults (aged ≥18 years) with severe eosinophilic asthma and a five-item Asthma Control Questionnaire score below 1·5 and who received at least three consecutive doses of benralizumab before screening. We randomly assigned patients (3:1) to taper their high-dose ICS to a medium-dose, low-dose, and as-needed dose (reduction group) or continue (reference group) their ICS-formoterol therapy for 32 weeks, followed by a 16-week maintenance period. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients reducing their ICS-formoterol dose by week 32. The primary outcome was assessed in the reduction group, and safety analyses included all randomly assigned patients receiving study treatment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT04159519.Findings:Between Nov 12, 2019, and Feb 16, 2023, we screened and enrolled in the run-in period 208 patients.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38059896,"Introduction:The 2021 American College of Gastroenterology Guidelines suggested using of intravenous erythromycin before endoscopy in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) to enhance endoscopic view and reduce the need for repeat endoscopy. Evidence on intravenous metoclopramide, which is more accessible, is scant, especially in patients with active UGIB. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of metoclopramide for gastric visualization in patients with active UGIB.Methods:Between April 10, 2021, and October 8, 2022, this double-blind, double-center randomized controlled trial enrolled patients with active UGIB (hematemesis or presence of fresh blood in the nasogastric tube). The eligible patients were randomly assigned in a concealed 1:1 allocation to metoclopramide or placebo. The primary outcome was adequate visualization by objective endoscopic visualized gastroduodenal scores (EVS). Secondary outcomes included mean difference in EVS, duration of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), immediate hemostasis, need for a second look EGD, units of blood transfusion, length of hospital stay, and 30-day rebleeding rate.Results:Of the 68 eligible patients, 3 of each group were excluded by protocol violation. Finally, 62 patients (31 metoclopramide and 31 placebo) were analyzed. The percentage of patients with adequate visualization in metoclopramide and placebo group was 77.4% and 61.6% (odds ratio [OR] 2.16 [0.71-6.58], P = 0.16). The need for a second look EGD in the 72 hours was lower in the metoclopramide group (3.2% vs 22.6%, OR 0.11 [0.01-0.99], P = 0.02), whereas the other secondary outcomes were not different. However, in gastric lesions subgroup analysis, metoclopramide improved the adequate visualization rate (92.9% vs 50%, OR 13 [1.32-128.10], P = 0.03) and mean EVS at fundus (1.79 ± 0.42 vs 1.29 ± 0.72; P = 0.03).Discussion:Metoclopramide did not improve endoscopic visualization but decreased the need for second look EGD in patients with overall active UGIB. It improved gastric visualization in those with UGIB due to gastric lesions, primarily by improving visualization in the fundus ( ClinicalTrials.gov numberNCT04771481)."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38044236,"Background:Enhanced recovery after surgery pathways are essential for ambulatory surgery. They usually recommend lower intraoperative opioid use to avoid opioid-related adverse effects. This has led to opioid-sparing anaesthesia (OSA) techniques, with the extreme approach of opioid-free anaesthesia (OFA) mostly with dexmedetomidine. As evidence is lacking in day-case primary total hip arthroplasty, this study was performed to assess the potential benefits in postoperative analgesia of OFA over OSA.Methods:In this single-centre, prospective, triple blind study, we randomly allocated 80 patients undergoing day-case primary THA under general anaesthesia. Patients received a total intravenous anaesthesia with a laryngeal mask and multimodal analgesic regimen with non-opioid analgesics. The OSA group received low dose of sufentanil, and the OFA group received dexmedetomidine The primary outcome was the opioid consumption in the first 24 h in oral morphine equivalents (OME).Results:There was no difference in median cumulative OME consumption at 24 h between the OSA and OFA groups (12 [0-25] mg vs 16 [0-30] mg, respectively; P=0.7). Pain scores were similar and low in both groups with comparable walking recovery time. Adverse events were sparse and equivalent in both groups except for dizziness, which was more frequent in the OSA group (P<0.05).Conclusions:In day-case total hip arthoplasty under general anaesthesia, opioid-free anaesthesia and opioid-sparing anaesthesia both provide early recovery and effective postoperative pain relief. When compared with opioid-sparing anaesthesia, opioid-free anaesthesia does not decrease opioid consumption in the first 24 h. These findings do not suggest any significant benefit from complete intraoperative avoidance of opioids.Clinical trial registration:NCT0507270."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38042725,"Background:Intraoperative opioid use has a positive relationship with postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and opioid-free anaesthesia (OFA) might reduce PONV. We investigated whether OFA compared with opioid-based anaesthesia would reduce PONV during the first 2 postoperative days among patients undergoing thoracoscopic lung resection.Methods:In this randomised controlled trial, 120 adult patients were randomly assigned (1:1, stratified by sex) to receive either OFA with esketamine, dexmedetomidine, and sevoflurane, or opioid-based anaesthesia with sufentanil and sevoflurane. A surgical pleth index (SPI) of 20-50 was applied for intraoperative analgesia provision. All subjects received PONV prophylaxis (dexamethasone and ondansetron) and multimodal analgesia (flurbiprofen axetil, ropivacaine wound infiltration, and patient-controlled sufentanil). The primary outcome was the occurrence of PONV during the first 48 h after surgery.Results:The median age was 53 yr and 66.7% were female. Compared with opioid-based anaesthesia, OFA significantly reduced the incidence of PONV (15% vs 31.7%; odds ratio [OR]=0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.91; number needed to treat, 6; P=0.031). Secondary and safety outcomes were comparable between groups, except that OFA led to a lower rate of vomiting (OR=0.23, 95% CI, 0.08-0.77) and a longer length of PACU stay (median difference=15.5 min, 95% CI, 10-20 min). The effects of OFA on PONV did not differ in the prespecified subgroups of sex, smoking status, and PONV risk scores.Conclusions:In the context of PONV prophylaxis and multimodal analgesia, SPI-guided opioid-free anaesthesia halved the incidence of PONV after thoracoscopic lung resection, although it was associated with a longer stay in the PACU.Clinical trial registration:Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2200059710)."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38040019,"Background:Many individuals without coeliac disease or wheat allergy reduce their gluten intake because they believe that gluten causes their gastrointestinal symptoms. Symptoms could be affected by negative expectancy. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of expectancy versus actual gluten intake on symptoms in people with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS).Methods:This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicentre study was done at the University of Leeds (Leeds, UK), Maastricht University (Maastricht, the Netherlands), and Wageningen University and Research (Wageningen, the Netherlands). People aged 18-70 years with self-reported NCGS (ie, gastrointestinal symptoms within 8 h of gluten consumption) without coeliac disease and wheat allergy were recruited. Participants had to follow a gluten-free or gluten-restricted diet for at least 1 week before (and throughout) study participation and had to be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (overall gastrointestinal symptom score ≤30 mm on the Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]) while on the diet. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1; blocks of eight; stratified by site and gender) to one of four groups based on the expectation to consume gluten-containing (E+) or gluten-free (E-) oat bread for breakfast and lunch (two slices each) and actual intake of gluten-containing (G+) or gluten-free (G-) oat bread. Participants, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to the actual gluten assignment, and participants were also masked to the expectancy part of the study. The primary outcome was overall gastrointestinal symptom score on the VAS, which was measured at and corrected for baseline (before breakfast) and hourly for 8 h, with lunch served after 4 h, and analysed per-protocol. Safety analysis included all participants incorporated in the per-protocol analysis. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT05779358, and has ended.Findings:Between Oct 19, 2018, and Feb 14, 2022, 165 people were screened and 84 were randomly assigned to E+G+(n=21), E+G-(n=21), E-G+(n=20), or E-G-(n=22). One person in the E+G+group was excluded due to not following test day instructions, leaving 83 participants in the per-protocol analysis. Median age was 27·0 years (IQR 21·0-45·0), 71 (86%) of 83 people were women, and 12 (14%) were men. Mean overall gastrointestinal symptom score was significantly higher for E+G+(16·6 mm [95% CI 13·1 to 20·0]) than for E-G+(6·9 mm [3·5 to 10·4]; difference 9·6 mm [95% CI 3·0 to 16·2], p=0·0010) and E-G-(7·4 mm [4·2 to 10·7]; difference 9·1 mm [2·7 to 15·6], p=0·0016), but not for E+G-(11·7 mm [8·3 to 15·1]; difference 4·9 mm [-1·7 to 11·5], p=0·28). There was no difference between E+G-and E-G+(difference 4·7 mm [-1·8 to 11·3], p=0·33), E+G-and E-G-(difference 4·2 mm [-2·2 to 10·7], p=0·47), and E-G+and E-G-(difference -0·5 mm [-7·0 to 5·9], p=1·0). Adverse events were reported by two participants in the E+G-group (itching jaw [n=1]; feeling lightheaded and stomach rumbling [n=1]) and one participant in the E-G+group (vomiting).Interpretation:The combination of expectancy and actual gluten intake had the largest effect on gastrointestinal symptoms, reflecting a nocebo effect, although an additional effect of gluten cannot be ruled out.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38008651,"Background:Previous studies demonstrated conflicting results regarding the determinants of gastric emptying for fluids. Our aim was to compare gastric emptying times of fluids with different caloric and nutrient content.Methods:Healthy adult volunteers underwent gastric ultrasound assessment for 4 h after consuming beverages with different caloric and nutrient content using a crossover design (oat drink with 3% fat [310 kcal], mango juice [310 kcal], oat drink with 0.5% fat [185 kcal], and blackcurrant juice [175 kcal]). Gastric emptying time, gastric content volume, and the area under the curve (AUC) of gastric content volume-time profiles were calculated.Results:Eight females and eight males completed the study protocol. The mean (sd) gastric emptying times were 89 (32) min for blackcurrant juice, 127 (54) min for oat drink with 0.5% fat, 135 (36) min for mango juice, and 152 (40) min for oat drink with 3% fat. Gastric emptying times were slower for oat drink with 3% fat (P=0.007) and mango juice (P=0.025) than for blackcurrant juice. At 1 h after ingestion, gastric content volume was greater for mango juice (P=0.021) and oat drink with 3% fat (P=0.003) than for blackcurrant juice.

We randomised 310 subjects to receive adamgammadex (4 mg kg-1) or sugammadex (2 mg kg-1) at reappearance of the second twitch of the train-of-four (TOF), and standard safety data were collected.Results:For the primary outcome, the proportion of patients with TOF ratio ≥0.9 within 5 min was 98.7% in the adamgammadex group vs 100% in the sugammadex group, with a point estimate and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.3% (-4.6%, +1.3%); the lower limit was greater than the non-inferiority margin of -10%. For the key secondary outcome, the median (inter quartile range) time from the start of administration of adamgammadex or sugammadex to recovery of TOF ratio to 0.9 was 2.25 (1.75, 2.75) min and 1.75 (1.50, 2.00) min, respectively. The difference was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.50); the upper limit was lower than the non-inferiority margin of 5 min. In addition, there were no inferior results observed in secondary outcomes. Adamgammadex had a lower incidence of adverse drug reactions compared with sugammadex (anaphylactic reaction, recurarisation, decreased heart rate, and laryngospasm; P=0.047).Conclusions:Adamgammadex was non-inferior to sugammadex with a possible lower incidence of adverse drug reactions compared with sugammadex.

VV116, an oral antiviral agent that has potent activity against SARS-CoV-2, was compared with a placebo in this phase 3 study to investigate its efficacy and safety in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.Methods:This multicentre, double-blind, phase 3, randomised controlled study enrolled adults in hospitals for infectious diseases and tertiary general hospitals in China. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio using permuted block randomisation to receive oral VV116 (0·6 g every 12 h on day 1 and 0·3 g every 12 h on days 2-5) or oral placebo (on the same schedule as VV116) for 5 days. Randomisation stratification factors included SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status and the presence of high-risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19. Inclusion criteria were a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, an initial onset of COVID-19 symptoms 3 days or less before the first study dose, and a score of 2 or more for any target COVID-19-related symptoms in the 24 h before the first dose. Patients who had severe or critical COVID-19 or who had taken any antiviral drugs were excluded from the study. The primary endpoint was the time to clinical symptom resolution for 2 consecutive days. Efficacy analyses were performed on a modified intention-to-treat population, comprising all patients who received at least one dose of VV116 or placebo, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, and did not test positive for influenza virus before the first dose. Safety analyses were done on all participants who received at least one dose of VV116 or placebo.

A total of 4579 patients with HBR were randomized at 1 month after PCI to abbreviated or standard DAPT. Data were analyzed from July 1 to October 31, 2022.Interventions:Abbreviated (immediate DAPT discontinuation, followed by single APT for ≥6 months) or standard (DAPT for ≥2 additional months, followed by single APT for 11 months) treatment groups.Main outcomes and measures:One-year net adverse clinical events (NACEs) (a composite of death due to any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or major bleeding), major adverse cardiac or cerebral events (MACCEs) (a composite of death due to any cause, myocardial infarction, or stroke), and major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (MCB).Results:Of the 4579 patients included in the analysis, 1408 (30.7%) were women and 3171 (69.3%) were men (mean [SD] age, 76.0 [8.7] years). Ischemic and bleeding events were similar between sexes. Abbreviated DAPT was associated with comparable NACE rates in men (hazard ratio [HR], 0.97 [95% CI, 0.75-1.24]) and women (HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.60-1.26]; P = .65 for interaction). There was evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect by sex for MACCEs, with a trend toward benefit in women (HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.44-1.05]) but not in men (HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.88-1.55]; P = .04 for interaction).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37982593,"Background:Pre-operative fasting is routinely advocated to avoid pulmonary aspiration. The European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) recommends a fasting period of 2 h for liquids before surgery. Liberal drinking policies such as the 'Sip Til Send' are a suggested alternative to maintain hydration before surgery.Objectives:To compare residual gastric volumes in fully fasted nonlabouring parturients before elective caesarean delivery with the 'Sip Til Send' with water liberal drinking protocol. Our hypothesis was the 'Sip Til Send' would be noninferior to standard fasting at minimising the residual gastric volume immediately before surgery.Design:A paired cohort prospective observational pragmatic study using gastric ultrasound, analysed by an operator blinded to the fasting status of each scan.Setting:A tertiary maternity hospital in Dublin, Ireland. The study was conducted between January and June 2023.Participants:Pregnant women about to undergo elective caesarean delivery who had followed ESAIC fasting guidelines before admission.Interventions:Each participant underwent two pairs (semi-recumbent and the semi-recumbent right lateral positions) of standardised ultrasound examinations of the gastric antrum: the order of these scans was randomised. The first pair of scans occurred on admission before the 'Sip Til Send' protocol commenced, the other pair just before spinal anaesthesia for caesarean delivery, after a variable time following the 'Sip Til Send' protocol.Main outcome measure:The primary outcome was the difference in antral cross-sectional area (CSA) between the fully fasted women on admission and the same women after following the 'Sip Til Send' protocol until just before spinal anaesthesia.Results:Fifty-eight women were randomised for the study: 55 and 54 scans in the semi-recumbent position on admission, and 55 and 54 scans in the right lateral position just before spinal anaesthesia. The mean differences (95% CI) in CSA in the semi-recumbent and RL positions were 0.07 (-0.39 to 0.53) cm 2 and 0.04 (-0.60 to 0.68) cm 2 , respectively. Since the of 95% CIs did not cross the predefined noninferiority margin of 0.88 cm 2 , 'Sip Til Send' was noninferior to fully fasting in in terms of the antral CSA.Conclusion:The 'Sip Til Send' protocol of liberal hydration with water was noninferior to standard fasting prior to elective caesarean delivery.Trial registry number:NCT05783427ClinicalTrials.gov."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37980922,"Background:Although the preferred management approach for patients with infected necrotising pancreatitis is endoscopic transluminal stenting followed by endoscopic necrosectomy as step-up treatment if there is no clinical improvement, the optimal timing of necrosectomy is unclear. Therefore, we aimed to compare outcomes between performing upfront necrosectomy at the index intervention versus as a step-up measure in patients with infected necrotising pancreatitis.Methods:This single-blinded, multicentre, randomised trial (DESTIN) was done at six tertiary care hospitals (five hospitals in the USA and one hospital in India). We enrolled patients (aged ≥18 years) with confirmed or suspected infected necrotising pancreatitis with a necrosis extent of at least 33% who were amenable to endoscopic ultrasound-guided drainage. By use of computer-generated permuted block randomisation (block size four), eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either upfront endoscopic necrosectomy or endoscopic step-up treatment. Endoscopists were not masked to treatment allocation, but participants, research coordinators, and the statistician were. Lumen-apposing metal stents (20 mm diameter; 10 mm saddle length) were used for drainage in both groups. In the upfront group, direct necrosectomy was performed immediately after stenting in the same treatment session. In the step-up group, direct necrosectomy or additional drainage was done at a subsequent treatment session if there was no clinical improvement (resolution of any criteria of systemic inflammatory response syndrome or sepsis or one or more organ failure and at least a 25% percentage decrease in necrotic collection size) 72 h after stenting. The primary outcome was the number of reinterventions per patient to achieve treatment success from index intervention to 6 months' follow-up, which was defined as symptom relief in conjunction with disease resolution on CT. Reinterventions included any endoscopic or radiological procedures performed for necrosectomy or additional drainage after the index intervention, excluding the follow-up procedure at 4 weeks for stent removal. All endpoints and safety were analysed by intention-to-treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT05043415andNCT04113499, and recruitment and follow-up have been completed.Findings:Between Nov 27, 2019, and Oct 26, 2022, 183 patients were assessed for eligibility and 70 patients (24 [34%] women and 46 [66%] men) were randomly assigned to receive upfront necrosectomy (n=37) or step-up treatment (n=33) and included in the intention-to-treat population. At the time of index intervention, seven (10%) of 70 patients had organ failure and 64 (91%) patients had walled-off necrosis. The median number of reinterventions was significantly lower for upfront necrosectomy (1 [IQR 0 to 1] than for the step-up approach (2 [1 to 4], difference -1 [95% CI -2 to 0]; p=0·0027). Mortality did not differ between groups (zero patients in the upfront necrosectomy group vs two [6%] in the step-up group, difference -6·1 percentage points [95% CI -16·5 to 4·5]; p=0·22), nor did overall disease-related adverse events (12 [32%] patients in the upfront necrosectomy group vs 16 [48%] patients in the step-up group, difference -16·1 percentage points [-37·4 to 7·0]; p=0·17), nor procedure-related adverse events (four [11%] patients in the upfront necrosectomy group vs eight [24%] patients in the step-up group, difference -13·4 percentage points [-30·8 to 5·0]; p=0·14).Interpretation:In stabilised patients with infected necrotising pancreatitis and fully encapsulated collections, an approach incorporating upfront necrosectomy at the index intervention rather than as a step-up measure could safely reduce the number of reinterventions required to achieve treatment success.Funding:None."

Diabetes management was performed by regular staff, guided by diabetes teams using insulin titration algorithms based on either point-of-care glucose testing or CGM. The primary outcome was the difference in time in range (TIR) (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) between the two arms. Outcomes were assessed during hospitalization.Results:The CGM arm achieved a higher median (interquartile range [IQR]) TIR of 77.6% (24.4%) vs. 62.7% (31.5%) in the POC arm (P < 0.001). Median (IQR) time above range (TAR) >10.0 mmol/L was lower in the CGM arm at 21.1% (24.8%) vs. 36.5% (30.3%) in the POC arm (P = 0.001), and time below range (TBR) <3.9 mmol/L was reduced by CGM, with a relative difference to POC of 0.57 (95% CI 0.34-0.97; P = 0.042). Prolonged hypoglycemic events decreased (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.13; 95% CI 0.04-0.46; P = 0.001), and the mean (SD) coefficient of variation was lower in the CGM arm at 25.4% (6.3%) vs. 28.0% (8.2%) in the POC arm (P = 0.024). Mean (SD) total insulin doses were reduced in the CGM arm at 24.1 (13.9) vs. 29.3 (13.9) IU/day in the POC arm (P = 0.049). A composite of complications was lower in the CGM arm (IRR 0.76; 95% CI 0.59-0.98; P = 0.032).Conclusions:In-hospital CGM increased TIR by 15 percentage points, mainly by reducing TAR. CGM also lowered TBR, glycemic variability, prolonged hypoglycemic events, insulin usage, and in-hospital complications."

Participants in the frozen embryo transfer group had all of their embryos cryopreserved and underwent frozen embryo transfer later. Participants in the fresh embryo transfer group underwent fresh embryo transfer after oocyte retrieval.Main outcome measures:The primary outcome was live birth, defined as the delivery of neonates with a heartbeat and respiration at ≥28 weeks' gestation. Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, singleton or twin pregnancy, pregnancy loss, ectopic pregnancy, birth weight, maternal and neonatal complications, and cumulative live birth after embryo transfers within one year after randomisation.Results:In an intention-to-treat analysis, the rate of live birth was lower in the frozen embryo transfer group than in the fresh embryo transfer group (32% (132 of 419)v40% (168 of 419); relative ratio 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.65 to 0.94); P=0.009). The frozen embryo group had a lower rate of clinical pregnancy than the fresh embryo group (39% (164 of 419)v47% (197 of 419); 0.83 (0.71 to 0.97)). The cumulative live birth rate was lower in the frozen embryo transfer group compared with the fresh embryo transfer group (44% (185 of 419)v51% (215 of 419), 0.86 (0.75 to 0.99)). No difference was observed in birth weight, incidence of obstetric complications, or risk of neonatal morbidities.Conclusions:Fresh embryo transfer may be a better choice for women with low prognosis in terms of live birth rate compared with a freeze-all strategy. The treatment strategies that prevent fresh embryo transfers, such as accumulating embryos with back-to-back cycles or performing routine preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy, warrant further studies in women with a low prognosis.Trial registration:Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2100050168."

Data analysis was performed from September 2023 to May 2024.Interventions:Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:2:2 ratio to usual care (group 1), direct outreach and bulk orders (group 2), and bulk order outreach with additional text message reminders for scheduling assistance (group 3). In group 3, participants received an initial, follow-up, and reminder text message. Patients with electronic portal accounts were encouraged to schedule through them, while others received laboratory contact information. Any participant inquiries were answered either with automated responses for common questions or with study team support.Main outcomes and measures:Proportion of patients who completed a lipid panel within 3 months.Results:Among the 1000 participants, the median (IQR) age was 38 (28-55) years; 470 (47.0%) were female; and 22 (2.3%) were Asian, 38 (3.9%) were Black, 32 (3.2%) were Hispanic or Latino, and 862 (88.6%) were White (race and ethnicity were based on self-reported data).

Electronic health record screening identified patients with dementia; caregivers confirmed eligibility, including dementia stage.Intervention:The intervention consisted of monthly calls from a trained nurse or social worker and evidence-based protocols to help caregivers manage patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms, caregiver distress, and palliative care issues (eg, advance care planning, symptoms, and hospice) (n = 99). Usual care caregivers received written dementia resource information and patients received care from usual clinicians (n = 102).Main outcomes and measures:The primary outcome was Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) severity score (scores range from 0-36, with higher scores indicating worse patient symptoms). Secondary outcomes included Symptom Management in End-of-Life Dementia scores, caregiver depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8) scores, caregiver distress (NPI-Q distress) scores, and combined ED and hospitalization events.

It is not known if incisional negative pressure wound therapy (iNPWT) can reduce SSI rates in this setting.Objective:To evaluate the effectiveness of iNPWT in reducing the rate of SSI in adults undergoing emergency laparotomy with primary skin closure.Design, setting, and participants:SUNRRISE was an assessor-masked, pragmatic, phase 3, individual-participant, randomized clinical trial. Adult patients undergoing emergency laparotomy in 22 hospitals in the UK and 12 hospitals in Australia between December 18, 2018, and May 25, 2021, were recruited. Patients were followed up for 30 days postprocedure; database closure was on August 25, 2021.Interventions:Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive iNPWT (n = 411), which involved a specialized dressing used to create negative pressure over the closed wound vs the surgeon's choice of wound dressing (n = 410). Randomization and dressing application occurred in the operating room at the end of the surgical procedure.Main outcomes and measures:The primary outcome measure was SSI up to 30 days postprocedure, evaluated by an assessor masked to the randomized allocation and using criteria from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were 7 secondary outcomes, including length of hospital stay, postoperative complications up to 30 days, hospital readmission for wound-related complications within 30 days, wound pain, and quality of life.Results:A total of 840 patients were randomized (536 from the UK; 304 from Australia). Overall, 52% were female; the mean age was 63.8 (range, 18.8 to 95.3) years. After postrandomization exclusions (N = 52), 394 participants per group were included in the primary analysis. The number of participants who had an SSI in the iNPWT group was 112 of 394 (28.4%), compared with 108 of 394 (27.4%) in the surgeon's preference group (relative risk, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.83-1.28]; P = .78).

We aimed to assess whether CCTA-guided care results in sustained long-term improvements in management and outcomes.Methods:SCOT-HEART was an open-label, multicentre, parallel group trial for which patients were recruited from 12 outpatient cardiology chest pain clinics across Scotland. Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years with symptoms of suspected stable angina due to coronary heart disease. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to standard of care plus CCTA or standard of care alone. In this prespecified 10-year analysis, prescribing data, coronary procedural interventions, and clinical outcomes were obtained through record linkage from national registries. The primary outcome was coronary heart disease death or non-fatal myocardial infarction on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01149590) and is complete.Findings:Between Nov 18, 2010, and Sept 24, 2014, 4146 patients were recruited (mean age 57 years [SD 10], 2325 [56·1%] male, 1821 [43·9%] female), with 2073 randomly assigned to standard care and CCTA and 2073 to standard care alone. After a median of 10·0 years (IQR 9·3-11·0), coronary heart disease death or non-fatal myocardial infarction was less frequent in the CCTA group compared with the standard care group (137 [6·6%] vs 171 [8·2%]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·79 [95% CI 0·63-0·99], p=0·044). Rates of all-cause, cardiovascular, and coronary heart disease death, and non-fatal stroke, were similar between the groups (p>0·05 for all), but non-fatal myocardial infarctions (90 [4·3%] vs 124 [6·0%]; HR 0·72 [0·55-0·94], p=0·017) and major adverse cardiovascular events (172 [8·3%] vs 214 [10·3%]; HR 0·80 [0·65-0·97], p=0·026) were less frequent in the CCTA group.

Data are scarce on the effects of discontinuing adalimumab after control of the disease had been reached. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of discontinuing treatment in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis.Methods:We conducted a multicentre, double-masked, randomised, placebo-controlled trial at 20 ophthalmology and rheumatology clinics across the USA, the UK, and Australia. Patients aged at least 2 years who had controlled arthritis and uveitis for at least 1 year on adalimumab were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio using a web-based system to receive adalimumab or placebo, administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks until the 48-week visit or treatment failure. The primary outcome was the time to treatment failure, defined by recurrence of uveitis or arthritis; all participants were included in the primary and safety analysis. Unmasking occurred at treatment failure, and patients were offered open-label adalimumab through 48 weeks of follow-up. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03816397).Findings:87 patients were enrolled from March 3, 2020, to Feb 14, 2024, whereafter the prespecified interim stopping criteria were met and enrolment was stopped. One patient in each group dropped out but data were included in analyses. Six (14%) of 43 patients in the adalimumab group and 30 (68%) of 44 patients in the placebo group had treatment failure (hazard ratio 8·7, 95% CI 3·6-21·2; p<0·0001). The median time to treatment failure in the placebo group was 119 days (IQR 84-243). The median time to re-establishing sustained control of inflammation in the placebo group after restarting adalimumab was 105 days (63-196). 226 non-serious adverse events occurred in the adalimumab group (7·5 events per person-year, 95% CI 6·5-8·5), and 115 non-serious adverse events occurred in the placebo group (6·8 events per person-year, 5·6-8·1). Four serious adverse events were reported, all in the adalimumab group.Interpretation:Discontinuing adalimumab led to higher rates of recurrence of uveitis, arthritis, or both in patients with previously controlled juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis. However, all patients who had treatment failure successfully regained control of inflammation by the end of the 48-week study period after restarting adalimumab.Funding:US National Institutes of Health (National Eye Institute)."

We aimed to investigate whether treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics in children is inferior to appendicectomy by comparing failure rates for the two treatments.Methods:In this pragmatic, multicentre, parallel-group, unmasked, randomised, non-inferiority trial, children aged 5-16 years with suspected non-perforated appendicitis (based on clinical diagnosis with or without radiological diagnosis) were recruited from 11 children's hospitals in Canada, the USA, Finland, Sweden, and Singapore. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the antibiotic or the appendicectomy group with an online stratified randomisation tool, with stratification by sex, institution, and duration of symptoms (≥48 h vs <48 h). The primary outcome was treatment failure within 1 year of random assignment. In the antibiotic group, failure was defined as removal of the appendix, and in the appendicectomy group, failure was defined as a normal appendix based on pathology. In both groups, failure was also defined as additional procedures related to appendicitis requiring general anaesthesia. Interim analysis was done to determine whether inferiority was to be declared at the halfway point. We used a non-inferiority design with a margin of 20%. All outcomes were assessed in participants with 12-month follow-up data. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02687464).Findings:Between Jan 20, 2016, and Dec 3, 2021, 936 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to appendicectomy (n=459) or antibiotics (n=477). At 12-month follow-up, primary outcome data were available for 846 (90%) patients. Treatment failure occurred in 153 (34%) of 452 patients in the antibiotic group, compared with 28 (7%) of 394 in the appendicectomy group (difference 26·7%, 90% CI 22·4-30·9). All but one patient meeting the definition for treatment failure with appendicectomy were those with negative appendicectomies. Of those who underwent appendicectomy in the antibiotic group, 13 (8%) had normal pathology. There were no deaths or serious adverse events in either group. The relative risk of having a mild-to-moderate adverse event in the antibiotic group compared with the appendicectomy group was 4·3 (95% CI 2·1-8·7; p<0·0001).Interpretation:Based on cumulative failure rates and a 20% non-inferiority margin, antibiotic management of non-perforated appendicitis was inferior to appendicectomy.Funding:None."

We aimed to examine the effect of oral finerenone, compared with placebo, on incident diabetes in the Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients with Heart Failure (FINEARTS-HF) trial.Methods:In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 6001 participants with heart failure with New York Heart Association functional class II-IV, left ventricular ejection fraction 40% or higher, evidence of structural heart disease, and elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were randomly assigned to finerenone or placebo, administered orally. Randomisation was performed with concealed allocation. The primary outcome of the trial was the composite of cardiovascular death and total (first and recurrent) heart failure events (ie, heart failure hospitalisation or urgent heart failure visit). In the present analysis, participants with diabetes at baseline (investigator-reported history of diabetes or baseline HbA1c≥6·5%) were excluded. New-onset diabetes was defined as a HbA1cmeasurement of 6·5% or higher on two consecutive follow-up visits or new initiation of glucose-lowering therapy. The full-analysis set comprised all participants randomly assigned to study treatment, analysed according to their treatment assignment irrespective of the treatment received (ie, intention to treat). The safety analysis set comprised participants randomly assigned to study treatment who took at least one dose of the investigational product, analysed according to the treatment actually received. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT04435626, and is closed to new participants.Findings:Between Sept 14, 2020, and Jan 10, 2023, 6001 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to finerenone or placebo. 3222 (53·7%) participants did not have diabetes at baseline and comprised the study population. During a median duration of follow-up of 31·3 months (IQR 21·5-36·3), 115 (7·2%) participants in the finerenone group and 147 (9·1%) in the placebo group developed new-onset diabetes, corresponding to a rate of 3·0 events per 100 person-years (95% CI 2·5-3·6) in the finerenone group and 3·9 events per 100 person-years (3·3-4·6) in the placebo group. Compared with placebo, finerenone significantly reduced the hazard of new-onset diabetes by 24% (hazard ratio [HR] 0·76 [95% CI 0·59-0·97], p=0·026). Fine-Gray competing risk analysis, accounting for the competing risk of death, yielded a similar finding (subdistribution HR 0·75 [0·59-0·96], p=0·024). Results were similar in sensitivity analyses, in which the definition of new-onset diabetes was expanded to include initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment with diabetes as indication, restricted to HbA1cmeasurements only, and restricted to new initiation of glucose-lowering drugs only (excluding SGLT2 inhibitor treatment). Findings were similar when participants treated with glucose-lowering drugs at baseline were excluded (n=15). The effect of finerenone, compared with placebo, on new-onset diabetes was consistent across key participant subgroups. Seven participants had an adverse event of new diabetes not captured by any of the definitions above.Interpretation:In participants with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction without diabetes, oral finerenone reduced the hazard of new-onset diabetes, representing a meaningful additional clinical benefit of this treatment in these individuals.Funding:Bayer."

The primary outcome was the composite of total HF events and cardiovascular death.Results:Among 5,587 patients with an eGFR measurement at both baseline and 1 month, 1,018 (18.2%) experienced a ≥15% decline in eGFR. The proportion of patients experiencing a ≥15% decline in eGFR was 23.0% with finerenone and 13.4% with placebo (OR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.69-2.24; P < 0.001). After adjustment, an eGFR decline was associated with a higher risk of the primary outcome in patients assigned to placebo (adjusted rate ratio: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.20-1.89) but not in those assigned to finerenone (adjusted rate ratio: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.84-1.35; Pinteraction= 0.04). By contrast, the efficacy of finerenone was consistent across the range of change in eGFR from baseline to 1 month (Pinteraction= 0.50 for percent change in eGFR), and safety, including hyperkalemia, was similar regardless of an early eGFR decline.Conclusions:Although an initial decline in eGFR was associated with worse outcomes in patients assigned to placebo, this relationship was not as strong in those treated with finerenone. An early decline in eGFR can be anticipated with finerenone and should not automatically lead to the discontinuation of this disease-modifying therapy (FINEARTS-HF Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients with Heart Failure [NCT04435626]; A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Bline, Parallel-Group, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the efficacy and safety of finerenone on morbidity and mortality in participants With Heart Failure [NYHA II-IV] and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥40% [EudraCT 2020-000306-29])."

The primary endpoint was the difference in baseline to day 90 change in MELD score (ΔMELD) between treatment and control groups (ΔΔMELD). Secondary endpoints included adverse clinical outcomes, non-invasive fibrosis biomarkers and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at 90 d, 180 d and 360 d. The ΔΔMELD between day 0 and day 90 in the treatment group compared to controls was -0.87 (95% confidence interval: -1.79, 0.0; P = 0.06); therefore, the primary endpoint was not met.

Participating clinicians were those who manage stroke prevention strategies for participating patients.Intervention:Patients were randomized to use a patient decision aid or usual care; clinicians were randomized to use an encounter decision aid or usual care with all participating patients.Main outcome measures:Primary outcome measures were quality of shared decision making measured by OPTION12, knowledge of atrial fibrillation and its management, and decisional conflict.Results:1117 participants across six sites were included in the analysis. Compared with usual care, the combined use of both the patient decision aid and the encounter decision aid improved the quality of shared decision making (adjusted mean difference 12.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 8.0 to 16.2; P<0.001), improved patients' knowledge (odds ratio 1.68 (95% CI 1.35 to 2.09; P<0.001), and reduced patients' decisional conflict (adjusted mean difference -6.3 (95% CI -9.6 to -3.1; P<0.001).

From 28 July 2022 to 31 October 2023, 591 outpatients aged 5-65 years with uncomplicated influenza underwent randomization in 46 research centers in China and were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive suraxavir marboxil (40 mg) or placebo within 2 days of symptom onset. The primary outcome was time to alleviation of influenza symptoms (TTAS) (from the start of treatment until body temperature returned to 37.2 °C or less and all seven influenza symptoms (cough, sore throat, headache, nasal congestion, feverishness or chills, muscle or joint pain, and fatigue) resolved for at least 21.5 h) within 15 days by treatment. The secondary endpoints included virological indicators, system and respiratory symptoms, PA variant mutation and adverse events. The median TTAS was significantly shorter in the group that received suraxavir marboxil compared to the placebo group (42.0 h versus 63.0 h, P = 0.002). Suraxavir marboxil was associated with more rapid decrease in viral load from baseline than placebo by 1 day after administration, with a mean change of -2.2 ± 1.3 compared to -1.3 ± 1.7 log10copies per ml (P < 0.001) in the placebo group. Adverse events were reported in 28.4% (112 of 395) of suraxavir marboxil recipients and 23.3% (45 of 193) of placebo recipients, most of which were mild or moderate.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39775039,"Small fetuses, with estimated fetal weight (EFW) below the tenth percentile, are classified as fetal growth restriction (FGR) or small for gestational age (SGA) based on prenatal ultrasound. FGR fetuses have a greater risk of stillbirth and perinatal complications and may benefit from serial ultrasound scans to guide early delivery. Abnormal serum angiogenic factors, such as the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1):placental growth factor (PlGF) ratio, have shown potential to more accurately distinguish FGR from SGA, with fewer false positives. This randomized controlled trial compared a management protocol based on the sFlt-1:PlGF with EFW and Doppler ultrasound in avoiding adverse perinatal outcomes in small fetuses after 36 weeks of gestation. A total of 1,088 pregnant women with singleton pregnancies were randomized to either the Doppler-based (control) or the sFlt-1:PlGF-based (intervention) protocol.

The incidence was 10.5% in the intervention group and 10.0% in the control group (absolute difference, 0.53 (-3.21 to 4.26)), with the upper limit of the confidence interval <8.5%, confirming noninferiority. Thus, the sFlt-1:PlGF was noninferior to EFW and Doppler ultrasound in avoiding neonatal acidosis or Cesarean delivery owing to nonreassuring fetal status in small fetuses after 36 weeks (ClinicalTrials.gov registration:NCT04502823)."

We identified evidence supporting broad effects of semaglutide, implicating processes related to body weight regulation, glycemic control, lipid metabolism and inflammatory pathways. Several proteins were regulated with semaglutide, after accounting for changes in body weight and HbA1cat end of trial, suggesting effects of semaglutide on the proteome beyond weight loss and glucose lowering. A comparison of semaglutide with real-world proteomic profiles revealed potential benefits on disease-specific proteomic signatures including the downregulation of specific proteins associated with cardiovascular disease risk, supporting its reported effects of lowering cardiovascular disease risk and potential drug repurposing opportunities. This study showcases the potential of proteomics data gathered from randomized trials for providing insights into disease mechanisms and drug repurposing opportunities.

In a previous study, we demonstrated the superior protective efficacy of a three-dose regimen of late-arresting genetically attenuated parasites administered by mosquito bite (GA2-MB) compared with early-arresting counterparts (GA1-MB) against a homologous controlled human malaria infection. Encouraged by these results, we explored the potency of a single GA2-MB immunization in a placebo-controlled randomized trial. Primary outcomes were safety and tolerability, time-to-parasitemia and protective efficacy. Humoral and cellular immunological results were considered secondary outcomes. Here we report the safe administration of GA2-MB with no breakthrough malaria and sterile protection in nine of ten participants at 6 weeks after a single immunization with 50 GA2-infected mosquitoes, compared with none of five mock-immunized participants, against a homologous controlled human malaria infection. Immunization increased circulating Pf-specific polyfunctional effector memory CD4+T cells coexpressing tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-2. This unprecedented 90% protective efficacy after a single low-dose immunization holds great promise for the potency of GA2 immunization. Future studies should demonstrate whether GA2 is similarly efficacious in pre-exposed populations and whether the favorable safety profile reported here holds up in larger groups.

The primary endpoint was a modified Packer score, including all-cause mortality, hospitalizations classified as potentially related to heart failure or exercise and changes in peak oxygen consumption (V̇O2), diastolic function (E/e'), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and global self-assessment (GSA). In total, 322 patients (mean age, 70 years; 192 females (59.6%) and 130 males (40.4%)) were randomized (1:1) to ET or usual care (UC). At 12 months, the modified Packer score showed an improvement in 33 ET patients (20.5%) and in 13 UC patients (8.1%) and showed a worsening in 69 ET patients (42.9%) and in 71 UC patients (44.1%) (Kendall's tau-b = -0.073, P = 0.17). Although the primary endpoint was not met, clinically relevant differences favoring the ET group as compared to the UC group were observed for the following secondary endpoints: changes in peakV̇O2(mean difference, 1.3 ml kg-1min-1(95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4-2.1)) and NYHA class (odds ratio = 7.77 (95% CI: 3.73-16.21)). No significant between-group differences were observed for other secondary endpoints, including change in E/e', change in GSA, time to cardiovascular hospitalization or all-cause mortality. In conclusion, 1 year of combined endurance and resistance ET did not result in a significantly better modified Packer score, but it did result in improvements in important clinical parameters, such as peakV̇O2and NYHA class, as compared to UC.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39709979,"Background:Spatial repellent products are used for prevention of insect bites, and a body of evidence exists on spatial repellent entomological efficacy. A new option for vector control, spatial repellent products are designed to release active ingredient into the air for disruption of human-vector contact thereby reducing human exposure to mosquito-borne pathogens. Clinical trials have shown spatial repellent epidemiological efficacy against Aedes-borne viruses but inconclusive outcomes against malaria. We aimed to show and quantify the protective efficacy of spatial repellents in reducing malaria infection incidence in Busia County, Kenya.Methods:A prospective, cluster-randomised, controlled trial in Busia County, western Kenya was done to quantify the efficacy of a transfluthrin-based spatial repellent against human malaria infection following mass distribution of insecticide treated nets. Investigators, staff, and study participants were masked to cluster allocation. Infection incidence was measured by microscopy in children aged 6 months to younger than 10 years during a 4-month baseline (March-July 2021) and 24-month follow-up period with intervention (October, 2021-October, 2023). From 58 clusters (29 intervention, 29 placebo), a total of 1526 and 1546 participants from two consecutive, 12-month cohorts were assessed for first-time malaria infection (primary endpoint) by survival analysis at interim and end-of-trial timepoints, respectively. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT04766879and is complete.Findings:The outcome of the primary endpoint indicated that spatial repellents significantly reduced the hazard rate of first-time malaria infection by 33·4% (95% CI 11·1-50·1; p=0·0058) and the hazard rate of overall new malaria infections by 32·1% (15·9-45·2; p=0·0004). No reported adverse events and serious adverse events were deemed to be associated with the spatial repellent.Interpretation:Our trial provides the first evidence of a demonstrative spatial repellent protective efficacy in reducing risk of malaria infection in an African setting characterised by high malaria transmission, pyrethroid resistant malaria vectors, and high coverage of insecticide treated nets. Results support spatial repellent products as a beneficial component of malaria prevention.Funding:This study was funded by Unitaid to the University of Notre Dame."

These post hoc analyses evaluated cardiometabolic and cardiorenal outcomes (a composite of death from CV causes or hospitalization for heart failure [HHF], CV death, HHF and an exploratory composite kidney outcome including ≥40% estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] decrease) by baseline BMI, using conventional clinical categories and Cox proportional hazards models.Results:In total, 8246 adults were randomized (mean age 64.4 years, diabetes duration 13.0 years, BMI 32.0 kg/m2, 61% with BMI >30 kg/m2). Absolute body weight reduction was greater with ertugliflozin versus placebo at 3 and 5 years in the overall population (p < 0.001) and across BMI subgroups. Ertugliflozin increased the proportion of participants achieving ≥5% and ≥10% body weight reduction (ertugliflozin 34.9% and 13.6%, placebo 19.4% and 4.1%; odds ratio [95% confident interval, CI], 2.21 [1.76-2.77] and 3.65 [2.39-5.57], respectively) at 5 years. No significant difference was observed in the effect of ertugliflozin on HHF across BMI subgroups (Pinteraction= 0.61). Similarly, no significant difference was observed in the effect of ertugliflozin on the kidney composite outcome across BMI subgroups (Pinteraction= 0.39). Results were similar for other CV outcomes, and safety was consistent with the known ertugliflozin profile.Conclusion:Weight loss was observed across baseline BMI and was sustained over 5 years of follow-up. The effects of ertugliflozin on HHF and kidney composite were consistent across baseline BMI."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39689849,"Background and aims:Moderate wine consumption has been associated with lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in older populations. However, wine consumption information through self-reports is prone to measurement errors inherent to subjective assessments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between urinary tartaric acid, an objective biomarker of wine consumption, and the rate of a composite clinical CVD event.Methods:A case-cohort nested study was designed within the PREDIMED trial with 1232 participants: 685 incident cases of CVD and a random subcohort of 625 participants (including 78 overlapping cases). Wine consumption was registered using validated food frequency questionnaires. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure urinary tartaric acid at baseline and after one year of intervention. Weighted Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of CVD.Results:Tartaric acid was correlated with self-reported wine consumption at baseline [r = 0.46 (95% CI 0.41; 0.50)]. Five categories of post hoc urinary tartaric acid excretion were used for better representation of risk patterns. Concentrations of 3-12 and 12-35 μg/mL, which reflect ∼3-12 and 12-35 glasses/month of wine, were associated with lower CVD risk [HR 0.62 (95% CI 0.38; 1.00), P = .050 and HR 0.50 (95% CI 0.27; 0.95), P = .035, respectively]. Less significant associations between self-reported wine consumption and CVD risk were observed.Conclusions:Light-to-moderate wine consumption, measured through an objective biomarker (tartaric acid), was prospectively associated with lower CVD rate in a Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular risk."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39688288,"Objective:The Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) model is used in 180 countries to address chronic disease care through a provider empowerment, tele-education approach. Few studies have rigorously evaluated the impact of the program on patient outcomes using randomized designs.Research design and methods:Implementation of an ECHO Diabetes program was evaluated using a stepped-wedge design with recruitment of 20 federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) across California and Florida with randomized, phased-in intervention entry. Participating FQHCs (referred to as ""spokes"") provided aggregate data, including the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) and diabetes technology use. Patients were recruited from spokes, and data collection involved historical and prospective HbA1c measures, HEDIS markers, and pre/post surveys. Linear mixed models were used to generate patient-level monthly HbA1c estimates and evaluate change over time; Poisson regression was used to model clinic-level technology use.Results:The spoke-level cohort included 32,796 people with type 1 diabetes (T1D; 3.4%) and type 2 diabetes (T2D; 96.6%), of whom 72.7% were publicly insured or uninsured. The patient-level cohort included 582 adults with diabetes (33.0% with T1D, 67.0% with T2D). Their mean age was 51.1 years, 80.7% were publicly insured or uninsured, 43.7% were non-Hispanic White, 31.6% were Hispanic, 7.9% were non-Hispanic Black, and 16.8% were in other race/ethnicity categories. At the spoke level, there were statistically significant reductions before and after the intervention in the proportion of people with HbA1c >9% (range 31.7% to 26.7%; P = 0.033). At the patient level, there were statistically significant increases in those using continuous glucose monitoring (range 25.1% to 36.8%; P < 0.0001) and pump use (range 15.3% to 18.3%; P < 0.001) before and after the intervention.Conclusions:The ECHO model demonstrates promise for reducing health disparities in diabetes and contributes to our understanding of program benefits beyond the provider level."

A comprehensive care plan was developed for the intervention group based on the integrated care model. We recruited individuals aged ≥18 years with type 2 diabetes and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ≥10). The primary outcome was the between-group difference in the percentage of patients who had at least a 50% reduction in depressive symptoms and a reduction of at least 0.5 percentage points in HbA1c. The outcome analysis was conducted within the intention-to-treat population; missing data were multiply imputed.Results:We enrolled 630 participants, with 275 in the intervention group and 355 in the control group. A significantly greater percentage of patients in the intervention group met the primary outcome at 12 months (for depressive symptoms: risk difference [RD] 31.03% [62.06% vs. 31.02%, respectively; 95% CI 21.85-40.21]; for HbA1c: RD 19.16% [32.41% vs. 13.25%, respectively; 95% CI 11.35-26.97]). The patients in the intervention group showed significant enhancements in mental quality of life (mean difference [MD] 6.74 [46.57 vs. 39.83, respectively; 95% CI 3.75-9.74]), diabetes self-care activities (MD 0.69 [3.46 vs. 2.78, respectively; 95% CI 0.52-0.86]), medication adherence (MD 0.72 [6.49 vs. 5.78, respectively; 95% CI 0.37-1.07]), and experience of care (MD 0.89 [3.84 vs. 2.95, respectively; 95% CI 0.65-1.12]) at 12 months. Rural participants benefited more from the intervention.Conclusions:The implementation strategy can serve as a valuable blueprint for the identification and treatment of patients with physical and mental multimorbidity in primary health care settings."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39667380,"Background:Blood loss and subsequent red blood cell transfusions are common in liver surgery. Hypovolaemic phlebotomy is associated with decreased red blood cell transfusion in observational studies. This trial aimed to investigate whether hypovolaemic phlebotomy is superior to usual care in reducing red blood cell transfusions in patients undergoing liver resection.Methods:PRICE-2 was a multicentre, single-blind, superiority randomised controlled trial. Patients at a higher risk of blood loss undergoing liver resection for any indication at four Canadian academic tertiary-care hospitals were randomised to receive hypovolaemic phlebotomy or usual care. Hypovolaemic phlebotomy consisted of the removal of 7-10 mL/kg of whole blood, without volume replacement, before liver transection. Patients were randomised centrally using permuted blocks of randomly variable length, stratified by centre. The randomisation sequence was computer-generated by an independent statistician. Surgeons, patients, and outcome assessors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was perioperative red blood cell transfusion to 30 days post-randomisation, analysed in all randomly assigned patients who underwent liver resection. PRICE-2 trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03651154) and is completed.Findings:Between Oct 1, 2018, and Jan 13, 2023, 486 individuals were randomly assigned to receive hypovolaemic phlebotomy (n=245) or usual care (n=241). 22 individuals in the hypovolaemic phlebotomy group and 18 in the usual care group did not undergo liver resection and were thus excluded from the primary analysis population. 223 patients were included in the hypovolaemic phlebotomy group (mean age 61·4 years [SD 13·0]; 137 [61%] men) and 223 in the control group (62·1 years [12·1]; 114 [51%]). 17 (8%) of 223 patients allocated to hypovolaemic phlebotomy and 36 (16%) of 223 patients allocated to usual care had a perioperative red blood cell transfusion by 30 days (difference -8·8 percentage points [95% CI -14·8 to -2·8]; adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 0·47 [95% CI 0·27 to 0·82]). Severe complications to 30 days occurred in 37 (17%) patients allocated to hypovolaemic phlebotomy and 36 (16%) allocated to usual care (aRR 1·06 [95% CI 0·70-1·61]). Overall complications to 30 days occurred in 135 (61%) of 223 patients allocated to hypovolaemic phlebotomy and 116 (52%) of 223 patients allocated to usual care (1·08 [0·92-1·25]). There was no postoperative mortality to 90 days.Interpretation:In patients undergoing liver resection, hypovolaemic phlebotomy reduced perioperative red blood cell transfusion and improved operative conditions, with no statistically significant increase in the incidence of complications compared with usual care. Hypovolaemic phlebotomy should be considered for routine use in patients undergoing liver resection at higher risk of bleeding.Funding:Canadian Institutes of Health Research (PJT-156108)."

BMI (kg/m2) was examined using World Health Organization categories, namely, underweight/normal weight (<25.0 kg/m2; n = 1,306); overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m2; n = 1,990); obesity class I (30.0-34.9 kg/m2; n = 1,546); obesity class II (35.0-39.9 kg/m2; n = 751); and obesity class III (≥40 kg/m2; n = 395). The primary outcome was cardiovascular death and total worsening HF events.Results:Data on baseline BMI were available for 5,988 patients (median: 29.2 kg/m2; Q1-Q3: 25.5-33.6 kg/m2). Compared with patients who were underweight/normal weight, those with obesity class II or III had a higher risk of the primary outcome (underweight/normal weight, reference; overweight, unadjusted rate ratio: 0.96 [95% CI: 0.81-1.15]; obesity class I: 1.04 [95% CI: 0.86-1.26]; obesity class II-III: 1.26 [95% CI: 1.03-1.54]). The effect of finerenone on the primary outcome did not vary by baseline BMI (underweight/normal weight, rate ratio: 0.80 [95% CI: 0.62-1.04]; overweight: 0.91 [95% CI: 0.72-1.15]; obesity class I: 0.92 [95% CI: 0.72-1.19]; obesity class II-III: 0.67 [95% CI: 0.50-0.89]; Pinteraction= 0.32). However, when BMI was examined as a continuous variable, the beneficial effect of finerenone seemed to be greater in those with a higher BMI (Pinteraction= 0.005). A similar pattern was observed for total worsening HF events. Consistent effects across baseline BMI were observed for cardiovascular and all-cause death and improvement in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores.Conclusions:In patients with HF with mildly reduced/preserved ejection fraction, the beneficial effects of finerenone on clinical events and symptoms were consistent, irrespective of BMI at baseline, possibly with a greater effect on the primary outcome in patients with higher BMI.

Adults with Type 2 Diabetes (diabetes), HbA1cof 7.5%-11.0% (inclusive) and taking at least one oral diabetes medication were eligible. In total, 269 participants were randomised across three arms [Usual care (UC): 117, diabetes management programme (DMP) (intervention without rewards): 36, DMP+ (intervention with rewards): 116]. Data were analysed using intention-to-treat analysis with change in HbA1cat month 12 between DMP+ and UC as the primary outcome. Cost-effectiveness of DMP+ relative to UC was also calculated.Results:Mean HbA1cimproved by 0.1% in UC and by 0.5% in DMP+ at 12 months, revealing a mean difference of 0.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.70, -0.08, p = 0.015).

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of filgotinib, an oral Janus kinase 1 preferential inhibitor, for treating Crohn's disease.Methods:This phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 371 centres in 39 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease for at least 3 months before enrolment. Patients were enrolled into one of two induction studies on the basis of their experience with biological agents (induction study A included biologic-naive and later biologic-experienced patients and induction study B included biologic-experienced patients). In both induction studies, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1), using an interactive web response system, to receive oral filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg, or placebo once daily for 11 weeks. Patients who received filgotinib and had two-item patient-reported outcome (PRO2) clinical remission or an endoscopic response at week 10 were re-randomised (2:1) to receive their induction dose or placebo orally, once daily to the end of week 58 in the maintenance study. Co-primary endpoints were PRO2 clinical remission and an endoscopic response at week 10 (induction studies) and week 58 (maintenance study). PRO2 clinical remission was defined as an abdominal pain subscore of not more than 1 and a liquid or very soft stool frequency subscore of not more than 3 (from eDiary data) and endoscopic response was defined as a reduction of at least 50% in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's disease from induction baseline (from central reading of endoscopy). For the induction studies, efficacy was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug. For the maintenance study, efficacy was assessed in all patients from either filgotinib treatment group in the induction studies who reached PRO2 clinical remission or an endoscopic response at week 10, and who were re-randomised and received at least one dose of study drug in the maintenance study. Patients who received placebo throughout the induction and maintenance studies were not included in the full analysis set for the maintenance study. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is complete and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT02914561.Findings:Between Oct 31, 2016, and Nov 11, 2022, 2634 patients were screened, of whom 1372 were enrolled (induction study A: n=707, induction study B: n=665, and maintenance study: n=481). There were 346 (49%) women and 358 (51%) men in induction study A, 356 (54%) women and 303 (46%) men in induction study B, and 242 women (51%) and 236 men (49%) in the maintenance study. Significantly more patients had PRO2 clinical remission at week 10 with filgotinib 200 mg than with placebo in induction study B (29·7% vs 17·9%, difference 11·9%; 95% CI 3·7 to 20·2, p=0·0039) but not induction study A (32·9% vs 25·7%, 6·9%; -1·4 to 15·2, p=0·0963); there was no significant difference for endoscopic response (induction study A: 23·9% vs 18·1%, difference 5·5%; 95% CI -2·0 to 12·9, p=0·1365; induction study B: 11·9% vs 11·4%, 0·1%; -6·5 to 6·6, p=0·9797).

Co-primary endpoints were not met for filgotinib 100 mg in any study. In the induction studies, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; ≥5% of patients in any group) were abdominal pain; arthralgia; an exacerbation, flare, or worsening of Crohn's disease; headache; nasopharyngitis; nausea; and pyrexia. In the maintenance study, the most frequently reported TEAEs (≥5% of patients in any filgotinib or associated placebo group) were those reported in the induction studies (except for headache) and abdominal distension, upper abdominal pain, anaemia, and flatulence. Serious TEAEs were reported in 49 patients in induction study A (18 [8%]) of 222 patients in the filgotinib 200 mg group, 16 [7%] of 245 patients in the filgotinib 100 mg group, and 15 [6%] of 237 patients in the placebo group), 81 patients in induction study B (19 [9%] of 202 patients in the filgotinib 200 mg group, 36 [16%] of 228 patients in the filgotinib 100 mg group, and 26 [11%] of 229 patients in the placebo group), and 49 patients in the maintenance study (13 [11%] of 118 patients in the filgotinib 200 mg-filgotinib 200 mg group, five [9%] of 56 patients in the filgotinib 200 mg-placebo group, 14 [13%] of 104 patients in the filgotinib 100 mg-filgotinib 100 mg group, three [5%] of 55 patients in the filgotinib 100 mg-placebo group, and 14 [10%] of 145 patients in the placebo-placebo group). No deaths were reported during the induction and maintenance studies.Interpretation:Filgotinib 200 mg did not meet the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and an endoscopic response at week 10, but did meet the co-primary endpoints at week 58.

A total of 590 adults scheduled for elective minimally invasive colon resection for benign or malignant disease were randomized 1:1 to 2% intravenous lidocaine or saline placebo. Enrollment occurred from August 13, 2018, to April 11, 2023, with a pause in recruitment from March 20, 2020, through July 6, 2020; final follow-up was on August 10, 2023.Interventions:The intervention patients received 2% intravenous lidocaine administered as 1.5-mg/kg bolus at induction of anesthesia followed by 1.5 mg/kg/h for 6 or 12 hours. Control patients received 0.9% saline placebo for 6 or 12 hours.Main outcomes and measures:The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with return of gut function at 72 hours after surgery, defined by the GI-3 composite end point of tolerating diet (ingestion of food and drink without significant nausea or vomiting for 3 consecutive meals) and passage of flatus or stool. There were 11 secondary outcomes, including time to GI-3 recovery, time to GI-2 recovery (tolerance of oral diet and passage of stool), prolonged postoperative ileus, postoperative nausea and vomiting score, Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score, postoperative opioid consumption, Quality of Recovery-15, quality of life (EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level), enhanced recovery protocol adherence, time to meeting medically defined criteria for discharge, and time to patient self-assessed readiness for discharge.Results:The trial enrolled 590 patients (295 intervention, 295 control); after 33 postrandomization exclusions, 557 patients were included (279 intervention, 278 control; 249 female patients [44.7%]; mean [SD] age, 66 [10.9] years); 532 (96%) received the randomized treatment. Return of gut function as defined by the GI-3 composite outcome was achieved at 72 hours by 160 patients (57.3%) in the intravenous lidocaine group vs 164 patients (59.0%) in the placebo group (adjusted absolute difference, -1.9% [95% CI, -8.0% to 4.2%]; relative risk, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.07]). There was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in any of the 11 secondary end points.Conclusions and relevance:Among patients undergoing elective minimally invasive colon resection, perioperative administration of 2% intravenous lidocaine did not improve return of gut function at 72 hours.Trial registration:isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN52352431."

The trial was conducted at 24 centers in France and Belgium (March 2021 to March 2023; latest follow-up in April 2024).Intervention:Patients were randomized to T-TEER + OMT or OMT alone.Main outcomes and measures:The primary outcome was a composite clinical end point at 1 year comprising change in New York Heart Association class, change in patient global assessment, or occurrence of major cardiovascular events. Tricuspid regurgitation severity was the first of 6 secondary outcomes analyzed in a hierarchical closed-testing procedure, including Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) score, patient global assessment, and a composite outcome of all-cause death, tricuspid valve surgery, KCCQ score improvement, or time to hospitalization for heart failure.Results:Of 300 enrolled patients (mean age, 78 [SD, 6] years, 63.7% women), 152 were allocated to T-TEER + OMT and 148 to OMT alone. At 1 year, 109 patients (74.1%) in the T-TEER + OMT group had an improved composite score compared with 58 patients (40.6%) in the OMT-alone group. Massive or torrential tricuspid regurgitation was found in 6.8% of patients in the T-TEER + OMT group and in 53.5% of those in the OMT-alone group (P < .001). Mean overall KCCQ summary score at 1 year was 69.9 (SD, 25.5) for the T-TEER + OMT group and 55.4 (SD, 28.8) for the OMT-alone group (P < .001). The win ratio for the composite secondary outcome was 2.06 (95% CI, 1.38-3.08) (P < .001).Conclusions and relevance:T-TEER reduces tricuspid regurgitation severity and improves a composite score driven by improved patient-reported outcome measures in patients with severe, symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT04646811."

Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive infliximab (IFX) and azathioprine (AZA) with a 7-day steroid tapering scheme (IFX+AZA arm) or AZA and conventional standardised steroid tapering regimen (AZA arm). The primary composite endpoint was treatment failure at week 52, defined as the absence of steroid-free clinical remission, the absence of endoscopic response, the use of a prohibited treatment for relapse, severe adverse event leading to treatment interruption, colectomy or death. Multiple imputation for missing data was performed.Findings:Among the 64 patients randomised (Lichtiger score 13.5±2.0; median age of 34.5 (P25-P75 26.3-50.3) years, median C reactive protein of 29.0 (12.8-96.8) mg/L at baseline): 32 were assigned to the IFX+AZA arm and 32 to the AZA arm. In the ITT population, treatment failure at week 52 was observed in 22/27 (81.5%) in the AZA arm and 16/30 (53.3%) in the IFX+AZA arm (risk ratio 3.85, 95% CI (1.15 to 12.88), p=0.03). 29 adverse events were severe, including 13 disease exacerbations, 6 severe infections without any difference between both arms.Interpretation:Combination therapy with IFX+AZA was more effective at 1 year than AZA alone to avoid treatment failure in patients with ASUC responding to intravenous steroids.Trial registration number:NCT02425852."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39576722,"Objective:To evaluate the association of four bone metabolism biomarkers (osteoprotegerin, osteopontin, sclerostin, and osteocalcin) with cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D).Research design and methods:The Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) was a randomized clinical trial evaluating the cardiovascular (CV) safety and efficacy of once-weekly exenatide for patients with T2D. Candidate biomarker data were selected from proteomic profiling performed at baseline and 12 months after randomization samples by SomaScan assay in 5,473 trial participants. The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (major cardiovascular events [MACE]). Cox proportional hazards models controlling for confounders were used for time-to-event analyses to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CI for a 1 SD increase in the biomarker concentrations.Results:The primary outcome occurred in 813 participants (14.9%). Higher levels of osteoprotegerin (HR 1.11; 95% CI 1.03-1.20; P = 0.0047) and osteopontin (HR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02-1.18; P = 0.0095) were associated with an increased risk of MACE. The addition of osteoprotegerin and osteopontin to a clinical predictive model containing traditional CV risk factors provided minimal incremental value for MACE prediction (C-index 0.629 vs. 0.638; likelihood ratio test P < 0.001). Osteocalcin and sclerostin were not associated with MACE. Osteocalcin had a nonlinear association with all-cause death and with CV death.Conclusions:Higher levels of osteoprotegerin and osteopontin are associated with an increased risk of CV events in people with T2D, supporting the hypothesis that pathways involved in bone metabolism play a role in CV disease."

Tirzepatide, a long-acting agonist of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors, causes considerable weight loss, but data are lacking with respect to its effects on cardiovascular outcomes.Methods:In this international, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 731 patients with heart failure, an ejection fraction of at least 50%, and a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of at least 30 to receive tirzepatide (up to 15 mg subcutaneously once per week) or placebo for at least 52 weeks. The two primary end points were a composite of adjudicated death from cardiovascular causes or a worsening heart-failure event (assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis) and the change from baseline to 52 weeks in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary score (KCCQ-CSS; scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life).Results:A total of 364 patients were assigned to the tirzepatide group and 367 to the placebo group; the median duration of follow-up was 104 weeks. Adjudicated death from cardiovascular causes or a worsening heart-failure event occurred in 36 patients (9.9%) in the tirzepatide group and in 56 patients (15.3%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.95; P = 0.026). Worsening heart-failure events occurred in 29 patients (8.0%) in the tirzepatide group and in 52 patients (14.2%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.85), and adjudicated death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 8 patients (2.2%) and 5 patients (1.4%), respectively (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.52 to 4.83). At 52 weeks, the mean (±SD) change in the KCCQ-CSS was 19.5±1.2 in the tirzepatide group as compared with 12.7±1.3 in the placebo group (between-group difference, 6.9; 95% CI, 3.3 to 10.6; P<0.001). Adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal) leading to discontinuation of the trial drug occurred in 23 patients (6.3%) in the tirzepatide group and in 5 patients (1.4%) in the placebo group.Conclusions:Treatment with tirzepatide led to a lower risk of a composite of death from cardiovascular causes or worsening heart failure than placebo and improved health status in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and obesity.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39551132,"Dialysis vascular access thrombosis poses a substantial challenge for individuals undergoing hemodialysis. The efficacy and safety of apixaban, a direct oral coagulation factor Xa inhibitor, in preventing recurrent access thrombosis have yet to be explored. Here, a multicenter randomized control study (NCT04489849) enrolled hemodialysis patients to evaluate this who underwent successful endovascular thrombectomy within 48 hours. Participants were assigned to standard care or standard care plus apixaban, 2.5 mg twice daily for three months. The trial design involved open-label administration, with independent adjudication of endpoints. The primary efficacy endpoint was recurrent access thrombosis within three months after thrombectomy. A total of 186 patients with well-balanced baseline characteristics were enrolled, 93 randomized to the apixaban group and 93 to the control group. The apixaban group demonstrated a significantly lower rate of access thrombosis at three months than the control group (24.0% vs. 40.8%; hazard ratio, 0.52 [95% confidence interval 0.31-0.88]), along with a significantly better primary patency failure rate (32.2% vs. 49.5%, 0.57 [0.36-0.91]). Safety outcomes showed comparable death rates and major bleeding incidents but significantly higher incidence of minor bleeding in the apixaban group (22.6% vs. 7.5%). The effect of apixaban did not show interaction in subgroups of different access types, antiplatelet usage, severity of comorbidities, or history of thrombosis. Thus, apixaban effectively reduced the risk of recurrent thrombosis in hemodialysis vascular access post-thrombectomy. Despite a minor increase in bleeding adverse effects, the net clinical benefit favors the use of apixaban in this context."

Enrollment was from August 15, 2022, to December 13, 2023; follow-up visits were 30 days after discharge.Interventions:Participants were randomized into the intervention group (CABG plus partial cardiac denervation) and the control group (CABG only) in a 1:1 pattern. All participants were continuously monitored for the incidence of POAF until day 6 after the operation.Main outcome and measures:The primary end point was the incidence of POAF in 6 days, defined as a supraventricular arrhythmia lasting for more than 30 seconds.Results:The trial enrolled 430 patients (79 [18.4%] female; mean [SD] age, 61.9 [7.8] years). Compared with the control group, the 6-day incidence of POAF was significantly lower in the intervention group (18.1% vs 31.6%; P = .001; risk ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.41-0.81]). To further support these results, a sensitivity analysis performed with Kaplan-Meier survival curves also showed a significant reduction in the occurrence of POAF in the intervention group (hazard ratio, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.36-0.79]; P = .002). Safety assessments showed no difference between the 2 groups, while postoperative medical cost was reduced in the intervention group.Conclusions and relevance:This randomized clinical trial found that partial cardiac denervation was an effective procedure to reduce the occurrence of POAF after isolated CABG without additional postoperative complications. These results suggest that partial cardiac denervation may be a good option for cardiac surgeons to consider for preventing POAF after CABG.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT05009914."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39549719,"Background:Setmelanotide, a melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonist, has been shown to reduce hunger and weight in patients aged 6 years and older with proopiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency (including biallelic variants in proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 [PCSK1]), leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency, or Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). No approved therapies for patients younger than 6 years old currently exist. The phase 3, open-label VENTURE trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of setmelanotide in patients aged 2-5 years with POMC or LEPR deficiency or BBS.Methods:This phase 3, open-label, multicentre trial, conducted across six sites in the USA, the UK, Spain, and Australia, enrolled eligible patients aged 2-5 years who had hyperphagia and obesity due to biallelic POMC (including PCSK1) or LEPR variants or genetically confirmed BBS. Open-label subcutaneous setmelanotide was administered once daily for 52 weeks, starting at 0·5 mg with doses increasing every 2 weeks in 0·5 mg increments until reaching the maximum dose based on weight. The co-primary endpoints at week 52 were the percentage of patients reaching a 0·2-point decrease or greater in BMI Z score (a statistical measure used to assess BMI in paediatric patients considering a patient's BMI and comparing it to reference values for the same age and sex) and mean percent change in BMI. Additional endpoints measured safety, hunger, weight-related outcomes, and caregiver burden. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04966741) and is complete.Findings:Between March 8, 2022, and Sept 18, 2023, 13 patients were screened at the six sites, and 12 patients were enrolled in the study (seven with POMC or LEPR and five with BBS); one patient with BBS was excluded as their BMI was not at the 97th percentile or above. Of the 12 patients enrolled, most were male (seven [58%] vs five [42%] for female) and the mean age was 3·6 years (SD 0·9). 11 patients completed the trial. Ten (83%) of the 12 overall participants reached a 0·2-point reduction or more in BMI Z score per WHO methodology at week 52 (95% CI 58·7-99·8). The mean percent change in BMI from baseline at week 52 was -18% (SD 13) in the overall safety population. Mean percent change in BMI at week 52 was -26% (SD 11) in patients with POMC or LEPR deficiency and -10% (9) in patients with BBS. Mean reductions in secondary endpoints of BMI Z score (3·4 [2·5]) and percent of the BMI 95th percentile (32·5 [22·9]) were seen at Week 52. 91% of caregivers reported that patients were less hungry than at baseline. All adverse events were mild or moderate; skin hyperpigmentation, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and injection site reactions were most common. No serious adverse events or adverse events leading to study discontinuation or death were reported.Interpretation:To our knowledge this is the first trial of setmelanotide in patients younger than 6 years old.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39521016,"Background:IMU-856 is an orally available and systemically acting small molecule modulator of sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), a protein that serves as a transcriptional regulator of bowel epithelium regeneration. We aimed to evaluate the safety, clinical activity, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of IMU-856 in healthy participants and in patients with coeliac disease.Methods:This study reports the results from a completed first-in-human, three-part, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of IMU-856 in healthy participants and patients with coeliac disease done in Australia and New Zealand. In part A, healthy participants were enrolled in six cohorts and randomly assigned (3:1) using a block randomisation algorithm to receive single ascending doses of IMU-856 ranging from 10 mg to 160 mg or matching placebo. Based on the results from part A, three doses were selected for part B to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of IMU-856 once daily for 14 days using the same randomisation algorithm. Part C enrolled patients with well controlled coeliac disease. Participants were centrally randomised 1:1:1 using an interactive web response system to receive either low dose or high dose of IMU-856 or placebo once daily for 28 days that included a 15-day gluten challenge starting on day 14. The primary objective was safety and tolerability of IMU-856. Safety analyses were done on all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. The trial is registered with the ANZCTR registry (ACTRN12620000901909).Findings:Between July 27, 2020, and Oct 28, 2022, 71 healthy participants were enrolled in part A and B and assigned to either placebo (n=19) or IMU-856 (n=52). In part A and B, the IMU-856 doses were 10 mg (n=6), 20 mg (n=6), 40 mg (n=13), 80 mg (n=12), 120 mg (n=4), 160 mg (n=11). 43 patients with coeliac disease were enrolled in part C and assigned to either placebo (n=14), IMU-856 80 mg (n=14), or IMU-856 160 mg (n=15). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 24 (73%) of 33 participants in part A and 15 (79%) of 19 participants in part B receiving any dose of IMU-856 compared with six (50%) of 12 participants in part A and five (71%) of seven participants in part B with placebo. TEAEs were mainly mild in severity. In part C, TEAEs occured in 26 (90%) of 29 patients on any dose of IMU-856 and ten (71%) of 14 receiving placebo; the most common TEAEs with any dose of IMU-856 by preferred term were headache (13 [45%] of 29), nausea (nine [31%]), diarrhoea (eight [28%]), and abdominal distension (seven [24%]). Two serious adverse events occurred with IMU-856 treatment (one in part B [bacterial myocarditis] and one in part C [biliary colic]), both of which were unrelated to IMU-856. No dose-limiting toxicities, systematic safety laboratory changes, or deaths occurred during the study. In part C, mean decrease in villous height was -20·9 μm (SD 34·8) among patients who received IMU-856 80 mg, -22·5 μm (51·1) among those who received IMU-856 160 mg, and -60·3 μm (52·2) among those who received placebo.Interpretation:The favourable safety profile, along with preliminary activity, suggests that IMU-856 should be studied in future trials of coeliac disease.Funding:Immunic Australia."

The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death and total worsening HF events. The KCCQ was completed by patients at randomization and at 6, 9, and 12 months after randomization. Change in KCCQ-TSS was a key secondary endpoint. Patients were stratified by KCCQ-TSS tertiles at baseline. The association between KCCQ tertile and clinical outcomes was evaluated using semiparametric proportional-rates models for total events and Cox models for time-to-first-event data, and the effects of finerenone vs placebo on the primary endpoint were assessed across tertiles of KCCQ-TSS.Results:Of the 6,001 participants in FINEARTS-HF, 5,986 (99.8%) had baseline KCCQ-TSS recorded (median score 69.8 of a possible 100; higher score = better health status). Lower (worse) KCCQ-TSS was associated with a higher risk of the primary endpoint. Finerenone, compared with placebo, reduced the risk of the primary endpoint across the range of KCCQ-TSS: tertile 1 (score 0-<57): RR: 0.82 (95% CI: 0.68-1.00); tertile 2 (57-<81): 0.88 (95% CI: 0.70-1.11); tertile 3 (81-100): 0.88 (95% CI: 0.69-1.14) (Pinteraction= 0.89). Compared with placebo, finerenone significantly improved KCCQ-TSS from baseline with a mean difference at 12 months of 1.62 points (95% CI: 0.69-2.56 points) (P < 0.001). Numerically fewer finerenone-treated patients experienced clinically meaningful deterioration, and more had improvements in KCCQ-TSS.Conclusions:Finerenone significantly reduced HF events and improved health status in patients with HF and mildly reduced ejection fraction/preserved ejection fraction across the spectrum of KCCQ-TSS at baseline.

Semen analysis and parameters of FH were measured at baseline and after 24 weeks of treatment. Participants completed questionnaires of the International Index of Erectile Function-15 (IIEF-15) and the Aging Symptoms in Men (AMS).Results:The quality of baseline sperm parameters of our study cohort was poor, below the 5th percentile of reference values. In the SEMA group, there was a significant increase in morphologically normal sperm from baseline to the end of the study (2% [2; 3.5] vs. 4% [2; 5.5]; p = 0.012), whereas sperm concentration and total number decreased significantly in the TRT group. Compared to TRT, the SEMA group had a significantly higher number of morphologically normal sperm, sperm concentration and total number. Both groups experienced an increase in total testosterone and improvement in the AMS score, whereas the IIEF-15 score significantly improved only in the TRT group.Conclusion:Semaglutide markedly improved sperm morphology, total testosterone levels and symptoms of hypogonadism.

We previously demonstrated that the endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) atrasentan reduced insulin resistance in T2D. In this study, we compared the effect of atrasentan on insulin resistance across different phenotypic clusters of patients with T2D.Materials and methods:We performed a post hoc analysis of the SONAR trial, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the ERA atrasentan in patients with T2D and CKD. Patients were stratified into four previously identified phenotypic clusters: severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD), severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD), mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD) and mild age-related diabetes (MARD). Changes in insulin resistance, assessed by HOMA-IR, were compared between the phenotypic clusters using a mixed effects model.Results:In total, 931 patients were included in the analysis. In the overall population, atrasentan compared to placebo reduced HOMA-IR by 12.9% [95%CI 3.5,21.4]. This effect of atrasentan was more pronounced in clusters characterized by insulin resistance or deficiency: (SIRD cluster 26.2% [95% CI 3.8,43.3] and SIDD cluster 18.5% [95%CI -3.8,35.9]), although the latter did not reach statistical significance. The effect of atrasentan compared to placebo was less pronounced in the other two clusters (MARD 12.2% [95% CI -1.7,24.12] and MOD -5.3% [95% CI -28.9,13.9]).Conclusions:Atrasentan significantly improved insulin sensitivity in patients with T2D and CKD, especially in those characterized by high insulin resistance (SIRD cluster).

In this prespecified analysis, we also report effects of finerenone on: 1) sustained ≥57% eGFR decline or kidney failure; 2) eGFR slope; and 3) changes in urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR).Results:Among 6,001 participants, mean baseline eGFR was 62 ± 20 mL/min/1.73 m2; 48% had eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Overall, 5,797 had baseline UACR data (median: 18 mg/g [Q1-Q3: 7-67 mg/g]). Over 2.6 years median follow-up, the incidence of the composite kidney outcome (≥50% eGFR decline or kidney failure) was numerically, but nonsignificantly, higher for finerenone vs placebo (75 vs 55 events; HR: 1.33; 95% CI: 0.94-1.89). Similar results were observed for the composite of ≥57% eGFR decline or kidney failure (41 vs 31 events; HR: 1.28; 95% CI: 0.80-2.05), although the overall event frequency was relatively low. During the first 3 months, finerenone led to an acute decline in eGFR of -2.9 mL/min/1.73 m2(95% CI: -3.4 to -2.4 mL/min/1.73 m2) but did not alter chronic (from 3 months) eGFR slope (+0.2 mL/min/1.73 m2per year; 95% CI: -0.1 to 0.4 mL/min/1.73 m2per year), vs placebo. The difference in total slope was -0.7 mL/min/1.73 m2per year (95% CI: -0.9 to -0.4 mL/min/1.73 m2per year.). Finerenone reduced UACR by 30% (95% CI: 25%-34%) over 6 months vs placebo, an effect that persisted throughout follow-up. Finerenone reduced the risk of new-onset of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria by 24% (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.68-0.83) and 38% (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.53-0.73), respectively.Conclusions:In FINEARTS-HF, a population at low risk of adverse kidney outcomes, finerenone did not significantly modify the kidney composite outcomes. Finerenone led to a greater reduction in initial eGFR, but did not result in a significant difference in chronic eGFR slope vs placebo. Finerenone led to early and sustained reductions in albuminuria and reduced the risk of new-onset micro- and macroalbuminuria.

Health status was assessed with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. Changes in health status over 1 year were compared between treatment groups using mixed-effects repeated-measures models.Results:The analysis cohort included 392 patients, of whom 259 underwent attempted TTVR and 133 received OMT alone (mean age 79.2 ± 7.6 years, 75.5% women, 56.1% with massive or torrential TR). Patients had substantially impaired health status at baseline (mean Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Overall Summary Score [KCCQ-OS] 52.1 ± 22.8; mean 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical component summary score 35.2 ± 8.4). TTVR+OMT patients reported significantly greater improvement in both disease-specific and generic health status at each follow-up time point. Mean between-group differences in the KCCQ-OS favored TTVR+OMT at each time point: 11.8 points (95% CI: 7.4-16.3 points) at 30 days, 20.8 points (95% CI: 16.1-25.5 points) at 6 months, and 17.8 points (95% CI: 13.0-22.5 points) at 1 year. In subgroup analyses, TTVR+OMT improved health status to a greater extent among patients with torrential or massive TR vs severe TR (treatment effect 23.3 vs 22.6 vs 11.3; interaction P = 0.049). At 1 year, 64.6% of TTVR+OMT patients were alive and well (KCCQ-OS ≥60 points and no decline of ≥10 points from baseline) compared with 31.0% with OMT alone.Conclusions:Compared with OMT alone, treatment of patients with symptomatic and severe or greater TR with TTVR+OMT resulted in substantial improvement in patients' symptoms, function, and quality of life. These benefits were evident 30 days after TTVR, continued to increase through 6 months, and remained durable through 1 year.

Establishing vascular access is critical for administering guideline-recommended drugs during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Both the intraosseous route and the intravenous route are used routinely, but their comparative effectiveness remains unclear.Methods:We conducted a randomized clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of initial attempts at intraosseous or intravenous vascular access in adults who had nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The primary outcome was a sustained return of spontaneous circulation. Key secondary outcomes were survival at 30 days and survival at 30 days with a favorable neurologic outcome, defined by a score of 0 to 3 on the modified Rankin scale (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability).Results:Among 1506 patients who underwent randomization, 1479 were included in the primary analysis (731 in the intraosseous-access group and 748 in the intravenous-access group). The successful establishment of vascular access within two attempts occurred in 669 patients (92%) assigned to the intraosseous-access group and in 595 patients (80%) assigned to the intravenous-access group. Sustained return of spontaneous circulation occurred in 221 patients (30%) in the intraosseous-access group and in 214 patients (29%) in the intravenous-access group (risk ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.24; P = 0.49).

An intraosseous route of drug administration may enable more rapid drug administration than an intravenous route; however, its effect on clinical outcomes is uncertain.Methods:We conducted a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial across 11 emergency medical systems in the United Kingdom that involved adults in cardiac arrest for whom vascular access for drug administration was needed. Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment from paramedics by means of an intraosseous-first or intravenous-first vascular access strategy. The primary outcome was survival at 30 days. Key secondary outcomes included any return of spontaneous circulation and favorable neurologic function at hospital discharge (defined by a score of 3 or less on the modified Rankin scale, on which scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability). No adjustment for multiplicity was made.Results:A total of 6082 patients were assigned to a trial group: 3040 to the intraosseous group and 3042 to the intravenous group. At 30 days, 137 of 3030 patients (4.5%) in the intraosseous group and 155 of 3034 (5.1%) in the intravenous group were alive (adjusted odds ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68 to 1.32; P = 0.74). At the time of hospital discharge, a favorable neurologic outcome was observed in 80 of 2994 patients (2.7%) in the intraosseous group and in 85 of 2986 (2.8%) in the intravenous group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.47); a return of spontaneous circulation at any time occurred in 1092 of 3031 patients (36.0%) and in 1186 of 3035 patients (39.1%), respectively (adjusted odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.97).

The hierarchical composite primary outcome was death from any cause, implantation of a right ventricular assist device or heart transplantation, postindex tricuspid-valve intervention, hospitalization for heart failure, an improvement of at least 10 points in the score on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary (KCCQ-OS), an improvement of at least one New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and an improvement of at least 30 m on the 6-minute walk distance. A win ratio was calculated for the primary outcome by comparing all possible patient pairs, starting with the first event in the hierarchy.Results:A total of 267 patients were assigned to the valve-replacement group and 133 to the control group. At 1 year, the win ratio favoring valve replacement was 2.02 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56 to 2.62; P<0.001). In comparisons of patient pairs, those in the valve-replacement group had more wins than the control group with respect to death from any cause (14.8% vs. 12.5%), postindex tricuspid-valve intervention (3.2% vs. 0.6%), and improvement in the KCCQ-OS score (23.1% vs. 6.0%), NYHA class (10.2% vs. 0.8%), and 6-minute walk distance (1.1% vs. 0.9%).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39471883,"Background:Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a right-sided valvular disease independently associated with morbidity and mortality. The TRILUMINATE Pivotal (Clinical Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular Outcomes In Patients Treated With the Tricuspid Valve Repair System Pivotal) is the first randomized controlled trial assessing the impact of TR reduction with tricuspid transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (T-TEER).Objectives:Outcomes from the full randomized cohort of the TRILUMINATE Pivotal trial have not been previously reported, and the additional enrollment may further support the safety and effectiveness of T-TEER through 1 year.Methods:The TRILUMINATE Pivotal trial is an international randomized controlled trial of T-TEER with the TriClip device in patients with symptomatic, severe TR. Adaptive trial design allowed enrollment past the primary analysis population. The primary outcome was a hierarchical composite of all-cause mortality or tricuspid valve surgery, heart failure hospitalizations (HFHs), and quality-of-life improvement measured by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) at 1 year.Results:Between August 21, 2019, and June 29, 2022, 572 subjects were randomized, including the primary cohort (n = 350) and subsequent enrollment (n = 222). Subjects were older (78.1 ± 7.8 years) and predominantly female (58.9%), with atrial fibrillation (87.8%) and prior HFH (23.8%). The primary endpoint was met for the full cohort (win ratio = 1.84; P < 0.0001). Freedom from all-cause mortality and tricuspid valve surgery through 12 months was 90.6% and 89.9% for the device and control groups, respectively (P = 0.82). Annualized HFH rate was comparable between device and control subjects (0.17 vs 0.20 events/patient-year; P = 0.40). A significant treatment effect was observed for change in quality of life with 52.3% of device subjects achieving a ≥15-point KCCQ score improvement (compared with 23.5% of control subjects; P < 0.0001). All secondary endpoints favored T-TEER: moderate or less TR at 30 days (88.9% vs 5.3%; P < 0.0001), KCCQ change at 1 year (13.0 ± 1.4 points vs -0.5 ± 1.4 points; P < 0.0001), and 6-minute walk distance change at 1 year (1.7 ± 7.5 m vs -27.4 ± 7.4 m; P < 0.0001). Freedom from major adverse events was 98.9% for T-TEER (vs performance goal: 90%; P < 0.0001).Conclusions:TriClip was safe and effective in the full randomized cohort of TRILUMINATE Pivotal with significant TR reduction and improvements in 6-minute walk distance and health status. Rates of all-cause mortality or tricuspid valve surgery and HFH through 1 year were not reduced by T-TEER."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39471309,"Importance:Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an established treatment option for many patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis; however, debris dislodged during the procedure can cause embolic stroke. The Sentinel cerebral embolic protection (CEP) device is approved for capture and removal of embolic material during TAVR but its efficacy has been debated.Objective:To explore regional differences in the association of CEP utilization with stroke outcomes in patients undergoing TAVR.Design, setting, and participants:This post hoc analysis of a prospective, postmarket, randomized clinical trial evaluating TAVR performed with or without the CEP took place at 51 hospitals in the US, Europe, and Australia from February 2020 to January 2022. Patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis treated with transfemoral TAVR were included. Randomization was stratified according to center, operative risk, and intended TAVR valve type. Patients were excluded if the left common carotid or brachiocephalic artery had greater than 70% stenosis or if the anatomy precluded placement of the CEP device. Data for this post hoc study were analyzed from August to October 2024.Intervention:TAVR with or without CEP.Main outcomes and measures:The primary end point was the rate of all stroke events at hospital discharge or 72 hours post-TAVR, whichever came first. Neurological examinations were performed at baseline and postprocedure to identify stroke, disabling stroke, and other neurological outcomes.Results:The Stroke Protection With Sentinel During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (PROTECTED TAVR) trial enrolled and randomized 3000 patients (1803 [60.1%] male; mean [SD] age, 78.9 [7.8] years): 1833 in the US cohort (TAVR alone: 919, TAVR with CEP: 914) and 1167 patients in the outside the US (OUS) cohort (TAVR alone: 580, TAVR with CEP: 587). Patients in the US cohort were younger, more predominantly male, had a lower prevalence of atrial fibrillation, and had a higher prevalence of bicuspid aortic valve, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease compared with the OUS cohort. In the main trial, the incidence of stroke within 72 hours after TAVR or before discharge did not differ significantly between the CEP group and the control group, and there was no interaction by geographic region. In this post hoc analysis, patients treated with CEP in the US cohort exhibited a 50% relative risk reduction for overall stroke and a 73% relative risk reduction for disabling stroke compared to TAVR alone; a treatment effect on stroke risk reduction was not observed in the OUS cohort.Conclusion and relevance:The PROTECTED TAVR trial could not show that the use of CEP had a significant effect on the incidence of periprocedural stroke during TAVR. Although there was no significant interaction by geographic region, this exploratory post hoc analysis suggests a trend toward greater stroke reduction in the US cohort but not in the OUS cohort. These findings are hypothesis generating, and further research is needed to determine if regional differences in patient characteristics or procedural practices affect CEP efficacy.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT04149535."

As the primary outcome, depressive symptoms showed significant improvement when measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale: active 9.41 ± 6.25 point improvement (10-week mean = 9.58 ± 6.02) and sham 7.14 ± 6.10 point improvement (10-week mean = 11.66 ± 5.96) (95% confidence interval = 0.51-4.01, P = 0.012). There were no differences in discontinuation rates. In summary, a 10-week home-based tDCS treatment with remote supervision in MDD showed high efficacy, acceptability and safety.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39420528,"Aim:The aim was to study the effect of two low-calorie, high-protein (HP) diets, with most of the protein coming from animal or plant sources, on glycaemic and other cardiometabolic outcomes in subjects with overweight or obesity and glucose metabolism disorders.Materials and methods:A total of 117 participants aged >18 years with body mass index over 27.5 kg/m2and prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were randomized to one of two HP low-calorie diets (35% of total calories from protein), in which 75% of the protein was from either plant-based sources (HPP) or animal sources (HPA). For both diets, 30% and 35% of the total calories were from fat and carbohydrates, respectively. The dietary intervention lasted 6 months.Results:Both diets improved body composition to a similar extent, including weight loss (-8.05 ± 5.12 kg for the HPA diet and -7.70 ± 5.47 kg for the HPP diet at 6 months) and fat mass, mainly visceral fat. Both diets had a similar beneficial effect on glucose metabolism, including fasting glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index and glycated haemoglobin. Other biochemical parameters, including lipid profiles, liver enzymes, adipokines and inflammatory biomarkers, similarly improved in both groups. Fasting incretins, mainly glucagon-like peptide 1, decreased significantly in both groups, and this effect correlated with weight loss.Conclusions:Low-calorie HP diets improved body composition, glucose metabolism and other cardiometabolic outcomes, regardless of protein source (either animal or plant sources), in outpatients with prediabetes or T2DM.Clinical trial registration:The clinical trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier:NCT05456347) https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05456347?term=NCT05456347&rank=1."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39389071,"Background:There is a need for additional therapeutic options for serious infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens. In the phase 3, descriptive REVISIT study, we investigated the safety and efficacy of aztreonam-avibactam in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections or hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP-VAP) caused, or suspected to be caused, by Gram-negative bacteria.Methods:This prospective, multinational, open-label, central assessor-masked study enrolled adults who were hospitalised with a complicated intra-abdominal infection or HAP-VAP. Patients were randomly allocated via block randomisation using interactive response technology stratified by infection type in a 2:1 ratio to aztreonam-avibactam (with metronidazole for complicated intra-abdominal infection) or meropenem with or without colistin for 5-14 days for complicated intra-abdominal infection or 7-14 days for HAP-VAP. The primary endpoint was clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit (within 3 days before or after day 28) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Secondary endpoints included 28-day mortality in the ITT population and safety in patients in the ITT population who received study drug (safety analysis set). No formal hypothesis testing was planned. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03329092) and EudraCT (2017-002742-68) and is complete.Findings:Between April 5, 2018, and Feb 23, 2023, we screened 461 patients. 422 patients were enrolled and randomly allocated (282 in the aztreonam-avibactam group and 140 in the meropenem group, forming the ITT analysis set), of whom ten patients (seven in the aztreonam-avibactam group and three in the meropenem group) were randomly allocated but did not receive study treatment. 271 (64%) of 422 patients had at least one Gram-negative pathogen from an adequate specimen identified at baseline. The most frequent baseline pathogens were Enterobacterales (252 [93%] of 271). Overall, 19 (24%) of 80 isolates tested for carbapenemases were carbapenemase-positive (serine, metallo-β-lactamase, or both). 193 (68·4%) of 282 patients in the aztreonam-avibactam group and 92 (65·7%) of 140 in the meropenem group had clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit (treatment difference 2·7% [95% CI -6·6 to 12·4]). For patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection, the adjudicated clinical cure rate was 76·4% (159 of 208) for the aztreonam-avibactam group and 74·0% (77 of 104) for the meropenem group. Cure rates in patients with HAP-VAP were 45·9% (34 of 74) for aztreonam-avibactam and 41·7% (15 of 36) for meropenem. 28-day all-cause mortality rates were 4% (12 of 282) for aztreonam-avibactam and 7% (ten of 140) for meropenem; in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection, mortality was 2% (four of 208) and 3% (three of 104) for aztreonam-avibactam and meropenem, respectively, and in patients with HAP-VAP, mortality was 11% (eight of 74) and 19% (seven of 36), respectively. Aztreonam-avibactam was generally well tolerated, and safety findings were consistent with the known safety profile of aztreonam monotherapy. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events in the aztreonam-avibactam group.Interpretation:These phase 3 efficacy and safety data provide support for aztreonam-avibactam as a potential therapeutic option for complicated intra-abdominal infection or HAP-VAP caused by Gram-negative bacteria.Funding:Pfizer."

Delandistrogene moxeparvovec, an adeno-associated rh74-viral vector-based gene therapy, addresses absent functional dystrophin in DMD. Here the phase 3 EMBARK study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of delandistrogene moxeparvovec in patients with DMD. Ambulatory males with DMD, ≥4 years to <8 years of age, were randomized and stratified by age group and North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) score to single-administration intravenous delandistrogene moxeparvovec (1.33 × 1014vector genomes per kilogram; n = 63) or placebo (n = 62). At week 52, the primary endpoint, change from baseline in NSAA score, was not met (least squares mean 2.57 (delandistrogene moxeparvovec) versus 1.92 (placebo) points; between-group difference, 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.45, 1.74; P = 0.2441). Secondary efficacy endpoints included mean micro-dystrophin expression at week 12: 34.29% (treated) versus 0.00% (placebo). Other secondary efficacy endpoints at week 52 (between-group differences (95% CI)) included: Time to Rise (-0.64 (-1.06, -0.23)), 10-meter Walk/Run (-0.42 (-0.71, -0.13)), stride velocity 95th centile (0.10 (0.00, 0.19)), 100-meter Walk/Run (-3.29 (-8.28, 1.70)), time to ascend 4 steps (-0.36 (-0.71, -0.01)), PROMIS Mobility and Upper Extremity (0.05 (-0.08, 0.19); -0.04 (-0.24, 0.17)) and number of NSAA skills gained/improved (0.19 (-0.67, 1.06)). In total, 674 adverse events were recorded with delandistrogene moxeparvovec and 514 with placebo. There were no deaths, discontinuations or clinically significant complement-mediated adverse events; 7 patients (11.1%) experienced 10 treatment-related serious adverse events. Delandistrogene moxeparvovec did not lead to a significant improvement in NSAA score at week 52. Some of the secondary endpoints numerically favored treatment, although no statistical significance can be claimed.

After the main treatment period, patients who received linagliptin plus placebo were treated with AJU-A51 for an additional 28 weeks. Change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to Week 24 was the primary endpoint.Results:AJU-A51 significantly reduced HbA1c levels (from 7.93% ± 0.82% to 7.11% ± 0.61%) compared with linagliptin plus placebo (from 7.80% ± 0.71% to 7.87% ± 0.94%), with a least squares mean difference of -0.88% (95% confidence interval -1.07 to -0.68; p < 0.0001) at 24 weeks. The AJU-A51 group had a significantly higher proportion of patients who achieved HbA1c <7.0% at Week 24 than the control group (44.8% vs. 18.6%; p < 0.001). The AJU-A51 group maintained glycaemic efficacy up to 52 weeks, whereas the control group showed a substantial reduction in HbA1c after switching to AJU-A51 in the extension study period. Both groups had similar incidence of treatment-emergent and serious adverse events, and no cases of symptomatic hypoglycaemia were reported.Conclusions:Dapagliflozin and linagliptin FDC (AJU-A51) showed potent glucose-lowering effects, with good tolerability, in patients with T2D who had poor glycaemic control on metformin and linagliptin (ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT06329674])."

There was a reversed J-shaped relationship of CKD progression with average ABI (ABI<1.17: HR per 1-SD decrement, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.06-1.42; ABI≥1.17: HR per 1-SD increment, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00-1.22) and average annual change in ABI (change in ABI less than-0.007: HR per 1-SD decrement, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.12-1.66; change in ABI of at least-0.007: HR per 1-SD increment, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.24).Limitations:Observational study, potential unmeasured confounding.Conclusions:Low and high-average ABI, even at clinically normal values, as well as decreasing and increasing average annual ABI, were associated with a higher risk of CKD progression in patients with T2DM and increased body mass index. Monitoring ABI and its changes over time may facilitate CKD risk stratification in patients with T2DM.Plain-language summary:The ankle-brachial index (ABI) has recently become a routine screening parameter for vascular complications in patients with diabetes. In this post hoc analysis of the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial including 3,631 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus and increased body mass index, we examined the longitudinal relationship of average ABI and annual change in ABI with chronic kidney disease progression.

In this prespecified analysis, we assessed the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and response to finerenone vs placebo in relation to the time from WHF to randomization (during or within 7 days, 7 days to 3 months, >3 months, or no prior WHF). The primary outcome was a composite of total (first and recurrent) WHF events and CV death, analyzed using a proportional rates method.Results:Of 6,001 patients validly randomized to finerenone or placebo, 1,219 (20.3%) were enrolled during (749 [12.5%]) or within 7 days (470 [7.8%]), 2,028 (33.8%) between 7 days and 3 months, and 937 (15.6%) >3 months from a WHF event; 1,817 (30.3%) had no prior history of WHF. Rates of the primary composite outcome varied inversely with time since WHF, with >2-fold higher risk in those enrolled during or within 7 days of WHF compared with those enrolled >3 months from WHF or without prior WHF (risk ratio [RR]: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.82-2.55). Compared to placebo, finerenone appeared to lower the risk of the primary composite to a greater extent in those enrolled within 7 days of WHF (RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.57-0.95) or between 7 days and 3 months of WHF (RR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.64-0.97) than in those >3 months from WHF or without prior WHF (RR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.81-1.21); however, no definitive treatment-by-time interaction could be confirmed (P = 0.07). Greater absolute risk reductions with finerenone were accordingly seen in those with recent WHF (Ptrend= 0.011). The risk of adverse events including hyperkalemia and worsening renal function among patients assigned to finerenone was not increased in those with recent WHF.Conclusions:Compared with those without recent WHF, patients with HF and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction who have experienced a recent WHF event are at higher risk for recurrent HF events and CV death; a possible signal of enhanced absolute treatment benefit with finerenone in this population requires further confirmation in future studies.

In FINEARTS-HF (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure), the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and total worsening HF events in patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. We examined the effect of finerenone according to LVEF in FINEARTS-HF.Methods:FINEARTS-HF was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial examining the efficacy and safety of finerenone in patients with HF and LVEF ≥40%. The treatment effect of finerenone was examined in prespecified analyses according to LVEF categories (<50%, ≥50% to <60%, and ≥60%) and with LVEF as a continuous variable. The primary outcome was a composite of total (first and recurrent) worsening HF events and cardiovascular death.Results:Baseline LVEF data were available for 5993 of the 6001 participants in FINEARTS-HF. Mean and median LVEF were 53±8% and 53% (interquartile range, 46%-58%), respectively. LVEF was <50% in 2172 (36%), between 50% and <60% in 2674 (45%), and ≥60% in 1147 (19%). Patients with higher LVEF were older, were more commonly female, were less likely to have a history of coronary artery disease, and more frequently had a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease compared with those with a lower LVEF. Finerenone reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and total HF events consistently across LVEF categories (LVEF <50% rate ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.68-1.03]; LVEF ≥50% to <60% rate ratio, 0.80 [0.66-0.97]; and LVEF ≥60% rate ratio, 0.94 [0.70-1.25];Pinteraction=0.70).

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone have both been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in this population, but the effects of their combined use are not known.Methods:FINEARTS-HF (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of finerenone in patients with HF and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥40%. Baseline SGLT2i use was a prespecified subgroup. The primary outcome was a composite of total (first and recurrent) worsening HF events and cardiovascular death. We first assessed for evidence of treatment heterogeneity on the basis of baseline SGLT2i use. We further examined SGLT2i uptake during the trial and evaluated the treatment effects of finerenone accounting for baseline and during-trial use of SGLT2i in time-varying analyses.Results:Among 6001 participants, 817 (13.6%) were treated with an SGLT2i at baseline. During 2.6 years median follow-up, treatment with finerenone similarly reduced the risk of the primary outcome in participants treated with an SGLT2i (rate ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.60-1.16]) and without an SGLT2i at baseline (rate ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.74-0.98];Pinteraction=0.76). In follow-up, 980 participants initiated SGLT2i, which was less frequent in the finerenone arm compared with placebo (17.7% versus 20.1%; hazard ratio, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.76-0.97]). Time-updated analyses accounting for baseline and subsequent use of SGLT2i did not meaningfully alter the treatment effects of finerenone on the primary end point.Conclusions:The treatment benefits of the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone were observed irrespective of concomitant use of an SGLT2i. These data suggest that the combined use of SGLT2i and a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist may provide additive protection against cardiovascular events in patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.Registration:URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier:NCT04435626."

The global Pivotal study has shown the EV ICD system to be safe and effective through 6 months, but long-term experience has yet to be published. Our aim was to report the performance and safety of the EV ICD system throughout the study.Methods:The EV ICD Pivotal study was a prospective, global, single-arm, premarket clinical study. Individuals with a Class I or IIa indication for a single-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator per guidelines were enrolled. Freedom from major system- or procedure-related complications and appropriate and inappropriate therapy rates were assessed through 3 years with the Kaplan-Meier method. ATP success was calculated from simple proportions.Results:An implantation was attempted in 316 patients (25.3% female; 53.8±13.1 years of age; 81.6% primary prevention; left ventricular ejection fraction, 38.9±15.4%). Of 299 patients with a successful implantation, 24 experienced 82 spontaneous arrhythmic episodes that were appropriately treated with ATP only (38, 46.3%), shock only (34, 41.5%), or both (10, 12.2%) for a Kaplan-Meier-estimated rate of first any appropriate therapy of 9.2% at 3 years. ATP was successful in 77.1% (37/48) of episodes, and ATP use significantly increased from discharge to last follow-up visit (P<0.0001). Shock therapy was successful in 100% (27/27) of discrete, spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias. The inappropriate shock rates at 1 and 3 years were 9.8% and 17.5%, respectively, with P-wave oversensing the predominant cause. No major intraprocedural complications were reported, and the estimated freedom from system- or procedure-related major complications was 91.9% at 1 year and 89.0% at 3 years. The most common major complications were lead dislodgement (10 events; n=9 patients, 2.8%), postoperative wound or device pocket infection (n=8, 2.5%), and device inappropriate shock delivery (n=4, 1.3%). Twenty-four system revisions were performed as a result of major complications related to the EV ICD system or procedure.Conclusions:From implantation to study completion, the EV ICD Pivotal study demonstrated that a single integrated system with an extravascular lead placed in the substernal space maintains high ATP success, effective defibrillation, and a consistent safety profile.Registration:URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier:NCT04060680."

The PB+Ex intervention included 12 weeks of meals, exercise sessions and group classes. Primary outcomes were glycaemic control (HbA1c, glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR) and glucose-lowering medication use. Secondary outcomes included lipids, blood pressure, heart rate and C-reactive protein. Only lab analysts were blinded.Results:Compared with SMC (n=90 randomised; n=70 analysed), the PB+Ex (n=79 randomised; n=66 analysed) intervention decreased HbA1cby an additional 14 mmol/mol (1.3%) at week 12 (-22 vs -7 mmol/mol [-2.0% vs -0.7%]; p<0.0001) and 8 mmol/mol (0.7%) at week 24 (-16 vs -8 mmol/mol [-1.4% vs -0.7%]; p=0.01). Concomitantly, 63% of medicated PB+Ex participants reduced their glucose-lowering medications (vs 24%; p=0.006), and 23% of PB+Ex participants with a baseline HbA1c<75 mmol/mol (<9%) achieved remission. Additionally, the PB+Ex intervention reduced weight (-2.7 kg; p<0.0001), C-reactive protein (-11 nmol/l; p=0.005) and cardiovascular medication use compared with SMC. At intermediate timepoints, it improved glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, cholesterol, triglycerides and heart rate, but not at week 24.Conclusions/interpretation:A whole-food, plant-based lifestyle intervention was more effective for improving glycaemic control than SMC. It also reduced the need for diabetes and cardiovascular medications and induced diabetes remission in some participants.

For this multicentre, primary care, open-label, multi-arm, prospective randomised controlled trial conducted in the UK, participants were eligible if aged at least 50 years, or at least 18 years with a comorbidity, and unwell 5 days or less with confirmed COVID-19 in the community. Participants were randomly assigned to the usual care group or molnupiravir group plus usual care (800 mg twice a day for 5 days), which was stratified by age (<50 years or ≥50 years) and vaccination status (at least one dose: yes or no). The primary outcome was hospitalisation or death (or both) at 28 days; all longer term outcomes were considered to be secondary outcomes and included self-reported ratings of wellness (on a scale of 0-10), experiencing any symptom (fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle ache, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, loss of smell or taste, headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, and generally feeling unwell) rated as severe (moderately bad or major problem) or persistent, any health and social care use, health-related quality of life (measured by the EQ-5D-5L), time off work or school, new infections, and hospitalisation.Findings:Between Dec 8, 2021, and April 27, 2022, 25 783 participants were randomly assigned to the molnupiravir plus usual care group (n=12 821) or usual care group (n=12 962).

Any severe (3 months: adjusted risk difference -1·6% [-2·6% to -0·6%]; probability superiority [p(sup)]>0·99; number needed to treat [NNT] 62·5; 6 months: -1·9% [-2·9% to -0·9%]; p(sup)>0·99, NNT 52·6) or persistent symptoms (3 months: adjusted risk difference -2·1% [-2·9% to -1·5%]; p(sup)>0·99; NNT 47·6; 6 months: -2·5% [-3·3% to -1·6%]; p(sup)>0·99; NNT 40) were reduced in severity, and health-related quality of life (measured by the EQ-5D-5L) improved in the molnupiravir plus usual care group at 3 months and 6 months (3 months: adjusted mean difference 1·08 [0·65 to 1·53]; p(sup)>0·99; 6 months: 1·09 [0·63 to 1·55]; p(sup)>0·99). Ratings of wellness (3 months: adjusted mean difference 0·15 (0·11 to 0·19); p(sup)>0·99; 6 months: 0·12 (0·07 to 0·16); p(sup)>0·99), experiencing any more severe symptom (3 months; adjusted risk difference -1·6% [-2·6% to -0·6%]; p(sup)=0·99; 6 months: -1·9% [-2·9% to -0·9%]; p(sup)>0·99), and health-care use (3 months: adjusted risk difference -1·4% [-2·3% to -0·4%]; p(sup)>0·99; NNT 71·4; 6 months: -0·5% [-1·5% to 0·4%]; p(sup)>0·99; NNT 200) had high probabilities of superiority with molnupiravir treatment. There were significant differences in persistence of any symptom (910 [8·9%] of 10 190 vs 1027 [11%] of 9332, NNT 67) at 6 months, and reported time off work at 3 months (2017 [17·9%] of 11 274 vs 2385 [22·4%] of 10 628) and 6 months (460 [4·4%] of 10 562 vs 527 [5·4%] of 9846; NNT 100). There were no differences in hospitalisations at long-term follow-up.Interpretation:In a vaccinated population, people treated with molnupiravir for acute COVID-19 felt better, experienced fewer and less severe COVID-19 associated symptoms, accessed health care less often, and took less time off work at 6 months. However, the absolute differences in this open-label design are small with high numbers needed to treat.Funding:UK Research and Innovation and National Institute for Health and Care Research."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39243794,"Background:Chikungunya outbreaks have been reported in Brazil since 2014. Adolescents are a sensitive population who would benefit from a prophylactic vaccine. This study assessed the immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine VLA1553 in adolescents in Brazil. With an overall trial duration of 12 months, we now report data on safety and immunogenicity over a period of 28 days after vaccination.Methods:In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, adolescents aged 12 to <18 years were recruited. The trial was performed at ten trial sites across Brazil. Eligible participants were generally healthy. The main exclusion criteria comprised immune-mediated or chronic arthritis or arthralgia, a known or suspected defect of the immune system, or any live vaccine received within the 4 weeks before trial vaccination. Randomisation was stratified by baseline serostatus in a 2:1 ratio to receive VLA1553 (at a dose of 1 × 104TCID50per 0·5 mL [ie, 50% tissue culture infectious dose]) or placebo. VLA1553 or placebo was administered intramuscularly as a single-dose immunisation on day 1. The primary endpoint was the proportion of baseline seronegative participants with chikungunya virus neutralising antibody levels of 150 or more in μPRNT50(a micro plaque reduction neutralisation test), which was considered a surrogate of protection. The safety analysis included all participants receiving a trial vaccination. Immunogenicity analyses were performed in a subset. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT04650399.Findings:Between Feb 14, 2022, and March 14, 2023, 754 participants received a trial vaccination (502 received VLA1553 and 252 received placebo) with a per-protocol population of 351 participants for immunogenicity analyses (303 in the VLA1553 group and 48 in the placebo group). In participants who were seronegative at baseline, VLA1553 induced seroprotective chikungunya virus neutralising antibody levels in 247 of 250 (98·8%, 95% CI 96·5-99·8) participants 28 days after vaccination. In seropositive participants, the baseline seroprotection rate of 96·2% increased to 100% after vaccination with VLA1553. Most (365 [93%] of 393) adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity, VLA1553 was generally well tolerated. When compared with placebo, participants exposed to VLA1553 had a significantly higher frequency of related adverse events (351 [69·9%] of 502 vs 121 [48·0%] of 252; p<0·0001), mostly headache, myalgia, fatigue, and fever. Among four reported serious adverse events (three in the VLA1553 group and one in the placebo group), one was classified as possibly related to VLA1553: a high-grade fever. Among 20 adverse events of special interest (ie, symptoms suggesting chikungunya-like disease), 16 were classified as related to trial vaccination (15 in the VLA1553 group and one in the placebo group), with severe symptoms reported in four participants (fever, headache, or arthralgia). 17 adverse events of special interest resolved within 1 week. Among 85 participants with arthralgia (68 in the VLA1553 group and 17 in the placebo group), eight adolescents had short-lived (range 1-5 days), mostly mild recurring episodes (seven in the VLA1553 group and one in the placebo group). The median duration of arthralgia was 1 day (range 1-5 days). The frequency of injection site adverse events for VLA1553 was higher than in the placebo group (161 [32%] vs 62 [25%]), but rarely severe (two [<1%] in the VLA1553 group and one [<1%] in the placebo group). After administration of VLA1553, there was a significantly lower frequency of solicited adverse events in participants who were seropositive at baseline compared with those who were seronegative (53% vs 74%; p<0·0001) including headache, fatigue, fever, and arthralgia.Interpretation:VLA1553 was generally safe and induced seroprotective titres in almost all vaccinated adolescents with favourable safety data in adolescents who were seropositive at baseline. The data support the use of VLA1553 for the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus among adolescents and in endemic areas.Funding:Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation and EU Horizon 2020.Translation:For the Portuguese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39225267,"Background:Stroke prevention with direct-acting oral anticoagulant agents in patients with atrial fibrillation confers a risk of bleeding and limits their use. Asundexian, an activated factor XI (XIa) inhibitor, is an oral anticoagulant that may prevent strokes with less bleeding.Methods:In a phase 3, international, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation in a 1:1 ratio to receive asundexian at a dose of 50 mg once daily or standard-dose apixaban. The primary efficacy objective was to determine whether asundexian is at least noninferior to apixaban for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety objective was to determine whether asundexian is superior to apixaban with respect to major bleeding events.Results:A total of 14,810 randomly assigned patients were included in the intention-to-treat population. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 73.9±7.7 years, 35.2% were women, 18.6% had chronic kidney disease, 18.2% had a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, 16.8% had received oral anticoagulants for no more than 6 weeks, and the mean CHA2DS2-VASc score (range, 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of stroke) was 4.3±1.3. The trial was stopped prematurely at the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee. Stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 98 patients (1.3%) assigned to receive asundexian and in 26 (0.4%) assigned to receive apixaban (hazard ratio, 3.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.46 to 5.83). Major bleeding occurred in 17 patients (0.2%) who received asundexian and in 53 (0.7%) who received apixaban (hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.55). The incidence of any adverse event appeared to be similar in the two groups.Conclusions:Among patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke, treatment with asundexian at a dose of 50 mg once daily was associated with a higher incidence of stroke or systemic embolism than treatment with apixaban in the period before the trial was stopped prematurely. There were fewer major bleeding events with asundexian than with apixaban during this time. (Funded by Bayer; OCEANIC-AF ClinicalTrials.gov number,NCT05643573; EudraCT number, 2022-000758-28.)."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39225259,"Background:Persistent chylomicronemia is a genetic recessive disorder that is classically caused by familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), but it also has multifactorial causes. The disorder is associated with the risk of recurrent acute pancreatitis. Plozasiran is a small interfering RNA that reduces hepatic production of apolipoprotein C-III and circulating triglycerides.Methods:In a phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 75 patients with persistent chylomicronemia (with or without a genetic diagnosis) to receive subcutaneous plozasiran (25 mg or 50 mg) or placebo every 3 months for 12 months. The primary end point was the median percent change from baseline in the fasting triglyceride level at 10 months. Key secondary end points were the percent change in the fasting triglyceride level from baseline to the mean of values at 10 months and 12 months, changes in the fasting apolipoprotein C-III level from baseline to 10 months and 12 months, and the incidence of acute pancreatitis.Results:At baseline, the median triglyceride level was 2044 mg per deciliter. At 10 months, the median change from baseline in the fasting triglyceride level (the primary end point) was -80% in the 25-mg plozasiran group, -78% in the 50-mg plozasiran group, and -17% in the placebo group (P<0.001). The key secondary end points showed better results in the plozasiran groups than in the placebo group, including the incidence of acute pancreatitis (odds ratio, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.94; P = 0.03). The risk of adverse events was similar across groups; the most common adverse events were abdominal pain, nasopharyngitis, headache, and nausea. Severe and serious adverse events were less common with plozasiran than with placebo. Hyperglycemia with plozasiran occurred in some patients with prediabetes or diabetes at baseline.Conclusions:Patients with persistent chylomicronemia who received plozasiran had significantly lower triglyceride levels and a lower incidence of pancreatitis than those who received placebo.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39217444,"Background and aims:Overtesting of low-risk patients with suspect chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) is widespread. The acoustic-based coronary artery disease (CAD)-score has superior rule-out capabilities when added to pre-test probability (PTP). FILTER-SCAD tested whether providing a CAD-score and PTP to cardiologists was superior to PTP alone in limiting testing.Methods:At six Danish and Swedish outpatient clinics, patients with suspected new-onset CCS were randomized to either standard diagnostic examination (SDE) with PTP, or SDE plus CAD-score, and cardiologists provided with corresponding recommended diagnostic flowcharts. The primary endpoint was cumulative number of diagnostic tests at one year and key safety endpoint major adverse cardiac events (MACE).Results:In total, 2008 patients (46% male, median age 63 years) were randomized from October 2019 to September 2022. When randomized to CAD-score (n = 1002), it was successfully measured in 94.5%. Overall, 13.5% had PTP ≤ 5%, and 39.5% had CAD-score ≤ 20. Testing was deferred in 22% with no differences in diagnostic tests between groups (P for superiority = .56). In the PTP ≤ 5% subgroup, the proportion with deferred testing increased from 28% to 52% (P < .001). Overall MACE was 2.4 per 100 person-years. Non-inferiority regarding safety was established, absolute risk difference 0.49% (95% confidence interval -1.96-0.97) (P for non-inferiority = .003). No differences were seen in angina-related health status or quality of life.Conclusions:The implementation strategy of providing cardiologists with a CAD-score alongside SDE did not reduce testing overall but indicated a possible role in patients with low CCS likelihood. Further strategies are warranted to address resistance to modifying diagnostic pathways in this patient population."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39216096,"Background:One third of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic-valve implantation (TAVI) have an indication for oral anticoagulation owing to concomitant diseases. Interruption of oral anticoagulation during TAVI may decrease the risk of bleeding, whereas continuation may decrease the risk of thromboembolism.Methods:We conducted an international, open-label, randomized, noninferiority trial involving patients who were receiving oral anticoagulants and were planning to undergo TAVI. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to periprocedural continuation or interruption of oral anticoagulation. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke from any cause, myocardial infarction, major vascular complications, or major bleeding within 30 days after TAVI.Results:A total of 858 patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat population: 431 were assigned to continuation and 427 to interruption of oral anticoagulation. A primary-outcome event occurred in 71 patients (16.5%) in the continuation group and in 63 (14.8%) in the interruption group (risk difference, 1.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.1 to 6.6; P = 0.18 for noninferiority). Thromboembolic events occurred in 38 patients (8.8%) in the continuation group and in 35 (8.2%) in the interruption group (risk difference, 0.6 percentage points; 95% CI, -3.1 to 4.4).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39215996,"Background and aims:Posterior wall isolation (PWI) is commonly incorporated into catheter ablation (CA) strategies for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) in an attempt to improve outcomes. In the CAPLA randomized study, adjunctive PWI did not improve freedom from atrial arrhythmia at 12 months compared with pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) alone. Whether additional PWI reduces arrhythmia recurrence over the longer term remains unknown.Methods:In this multi-centre, international, randomized study patients with persistent AF undergoing index CA using radiofrequency were randomized to PVI + PWI vs. PVI alone. Patients underwent regular follow-up including rhythm monitoring for a minimum of 3 years after CA. Atrial fibrillation burden at 3 years after ablation was evaluated with either 28-day continuous ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, twice daily single-lead ECG or from cardiac implanted device. Evaluated endpoints included freedom from any documented atrial arrhythmia recurrence after a single procedure, AF burden, need for redo CA, rhythm at last clinical follow-up, healthcare utilization metrics, and AF-related quality of life.Results:Three hundred thirty-three of 338 (98.5%) patients (mean age 64.3 ± 9.4 years, 23% female) completed 3-year follow-up, with 169 patients randomized to PVI + PWI and 164 patients to PVI alone. At a median of 3.62 years after index ablation, freedom from recurrent atrial arrhythmia occurred in 59 patients (35.5%) randomized to PVI + PWI vs. 68 patients (42.1%) randomized to PVI alone (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.88-1.51, P = .55). Median time to recurrent atrial arrhythmia was 0.53 years (interquartile range 0.34-1.01 years). Redo ablation was performed in 54 patients (32.0%) in the PVI + PWI group vs. 49 patients (29.9%, P = .68) in the PVI alone group. Pulmonary vein reconnection was present in 54.5% (mean number of reconnected PVs 2.2 ± .9) and posterior wall reconnection in 75%. Median AF burden at 3 years was 0% in both groups (interquartile range 0%-0.85% PVI + PWI vs. 0%-1.43% PVI alone, P = .49). Sinus rhythm at final clinical follow-up was present in 85.1% with PVI + PWI vs. 87.1% with PVI alone (P = .60). Mean AF Effect On Quality-Of-Life (AFEQT) score at 3 years after ablation was 88.0 ± 14.8 with PVI + PWI vs. 88.9 ± 15.4 with PVI alone (P = .63).Conclusions:In patients with persistent AF, the addition of PWI to PVI alone at index radiofrequency CA did not significantly improve freedom from atrial arrhythmia recurrence at long-term follow-up. Median AF burden remains low and AF quality of life high at 3 years with either ablation strategy."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39213194,"Background:Transthyretin amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a progressive, fatal disease. Vutrisiran, a subcutaneously administered RNA interference therapeutic agent, inhibits the production of hepatic transthyretin.Methods:In this double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned patients with ATTR-CM in a 1:1 ratio to receive vutrisiran (25 mg) or placebo every 12 weeks for up to 36 months. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause and recurrent cardiovascular events. Secondary end points included death from any cause, the change from baseline in the distance covered on the 6-minute walk test, and the change from baseline in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary (KCCQ-OS) score. The efficacy end points were assessed in the overall population and in the monotherapy population (the patients who were not receiving tafamidis at baseline) and were tested hierarchically.Results:A total of 655 patients underwent randomization; 326 were assigned to receive vutrisiran and 329 to receive placebo. Vutrisiran treatment led to a lower risk of death from any cause and recurrent cardiovascular events than placebo (hazard ratio in the overall population, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 0.93; P = 0.01; hazard ratio in the monotherapy population, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.93; P = 0.02) and a lower risk of death from any cause through 42 months (hazard ratio in the overall population, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.90; P = 0.01). Among the patients in the overall population, 125 in the vutrisiran group and 159 in the placebo group had at least one primary end-point event. In the overall population, treatment with vutrisiran resulted in less of a decline in the distance covered on the 6-minute walk test than placebo (least-squares mean difference, 26.5 m; 95% CI, 13.4 to 39.6; P<0.001) and less of a decline in the KCCQ-OS score (least-squares mean difference, 5.8 points; 95% CI, 2.4 to 9.2; P<0.001). Similar benefits were observed in the monotherapy population. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups (99% in the vutrisiran group and 98% in the placebo group); serious adverse events occurred in 62% of the patients in the vutrisiran group and in 67% of those in the placebo group.Conclusions:Among patients with ATTR-CM, treatment with vutrisiran led to a lower risk of death from any cause and cardiovascular events than placebo and preserved functional capacity and quality of life.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zastaprazan compared with esomeprazole in patient with erosive esophagitis (EE).Methods:A phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, noninferiority clinical study was conducted with 300 subjects with confirmed EE. Subjects were randomized to receive zastaprazan 20 mg or esomeprazole 40 mg once daily up to 8 weeks. The primary end point was the cumulative proportion of subject with healed EE confirmed by endoscopy at week 8. The secondary end points included the healing rate at week 4, symptom response, and quality of life assessment. Safety profiles and serum gastrin levels were also assessed.Results:In the full analysis set, the cumulative healing rate at week 8 were 97.92% (141/144) for zastaprazan and 94.93% (131/138) ( P = 0.178) for esomeprazole. The healing rate at week 4 in the zastaprazan group was higher than the esomeprazole group (95.14% [137/144] vs 87.68% [121/138]; P = 0.026). There was no significant difference between groups in healing rates (the per-protocol set) at week 8 and week 4, symptom responses, quality of life assessments, and safety profiles. In addition, serum gastrin levels increased during treatment in both groups, with a significant difference between the 2 groups ( P = 0.047), but both decreased after treatment.Discussion:An 8-week therapy of zastaprazan 20 mg is noninferior to esomeprazole 40 mg in subjects with predominantly low-grade EE.

Questionnaires were completed to assess gastrointestinal symptoms through IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS), quality of life, and psychological symptoms (Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21) at regular intervals during the program and 6 months following the conclusion on the intervention. The primary end point was the proportion of participants with ≥50-point decrease in IBS-SSS between the interventions at the end of the program.Results:Of 240/244 randomized participants, 121 received GDH Program-the median age 38 (range 20-65) years, 90% female, IBS-SSS 321 (interquartile range 273-367)-and 119 Active Control-36 (21-65), 91% female, IBS-SSS 303 (255-360). At program completion, 81% met the primary end point with GDH Program vs 63% Active Control ( P = 0.002).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40019152,"Introduction:Conclusions regarding the suction techniques of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) remain controversial. This study aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the dry suction vs wet suction technique in solid pancreatic lesions (SPLs) and determine the optimal number of passes for EUS-FNB.Methods:This investigation was conducted as a multicenter, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial. Patients with SPLs were randomly allocated to receive either the dry or wet suction technique. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy. The secondary outcomes included sensitivity, specificity, optimal number of needle passes, specimen quality, procedure time, and adverse events.Results:Of the 200 patients, 193 were included in the final analysis, with 96 in the dry suction group and 97 in the wet suction group. The diagnostic accuracies were 97.92% and 96.91% in the dry and wet groups, respectively, with a 1.01% difference between the study groups (2-sided 95% CI, -3.47% to 5.48%, P = 0.659). The overall adverse event rate was 2.6%. No significant differences were observed in sample adequacy (98.9% vs 98.9%, P = 1) or blood contamination ( P = 0.796). Regarding procedure time, there was no statistical difference (18.68 ± 8.03 minutes vs 19.36 ± 8.89 minutes, P = 0.626); however, more procedural steps were required in the wet suction technique. No significant difference was found between the cumulative diagnostic accuracy of each needle (first pass 93.78% vs second pass 95.34% vs third pass 97.41%, P = 0.225).Discussion:The dry suction technique is noninferior to the wet suction technique for EUS-FNB in SPLs. In the absence of rapid on-site evaluation, only one pass was required to achieve more than 90% diagnostic accuracy ( ClinicalTrial.gov numberNCT05549856)."

Patients had HF and an ejection fraction of 40% or greater. Data analysis was conducted from September 1 to December 10, 2024.Intervention:Participants were randomized 1:1 to finerenone or placebo.Main outcomes and measures:Primary outcome events (cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, and outpatient urgent HF visit requiring intravenous diuretic therapy) were centrally adjudicated. In this prespecified analysis, outpatient oral diuretic intensification events were defined as initiations of loop or thiazide diuretic or increases in loop diuretic dosage. The risk of all-cause death following each type of worsening HF event (HF hospitalization, urgent HF visit, or outpatient oral diuretic intensification) and the effect of finerenone on outpatient oral diuretic intensification alone or as part of an extended composite outcome with primary outcome events were evaluated.Results:A total of 6001 participants (mean [SD] age, 72.0 [9.6] years; 2732 [46%] female) were enrolled. First worsening HF events included 664 HF hospitalizations, 87 urgent HF visits, and 1250 oral diuretic intensifications. Rates of death were higher following worsening HF: 27.7 (95% CI, 24.3-31.5) per 100 patient-years after HF hospitalization, 13.6 (95% CI, 8.8-21.1) per 100 patient-years after urgent HF visit, and 11.6 (95% CI, 10.2-13.1) per 100 patient-years after outpatient oral diuretic intensification compared with 4.5 (95% CI, 4.2-4.9) per 100 patient-years for patients without worsening HF. Adding outpatient oral diuretic intensification to the primary outcome increased the number of patients experiencing events from 1343 to 2238. Finerenone reduced outpatient oral diuretic intensification alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89 [95% CI, 0.80-0.98]; P = .02) and in an extended composite outcome that further included cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, and urgent HF visit (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.78-0.92]; P < .001).Conclusions and relevance:Outpatient worsening HF events requiring oral diuretic intensification were common, associated with poor prognosis, and reduced by finerenone in patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT04435626."

Combining polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid (PEG-Asc) with adjuvants has been explored to enhance cleansing efficacy and reduce the required volume. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether adding 0.5 mg linaclotide to 1 L PEG-Asc (1 L-PEG/AL) improves superior cleansing compared with adding 24 mg senna (1 L-PEG/AS), which we previously reported to be noninferior to the standard regimen of 2 L PEG-Asc.Methods:A multicenter, endoscopist-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted at 5 centers in Japan with outpatients scheduled for colonoscopy. The primary outcome was adequate BP, evaluated using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale. Analyses were stratified based on low-risk and high-risk groups for inadequate BP.Results:Between April 2022 and April 2023, 1,464 patients were randomized to the 1L-PEG/AL (n = 731) or 1L-PEG/AS (n = 733). The 1L-PEG/AL demonstrated higher adequate BP rates (92% vs 86%, P = 0.001) compared with 1L-PEG/AS. Both groups experienced similar adverse events and expressed high willingness for repeat BP (83% vs 81%, P = 0.49). In high-risk patients (n = 892), 1L-PEG/AL had significantly higher adequate BP rates (94% vs 86%, P < 0.001), whereas rates were comparably high in low-risk patients (n = 539) (94% vs 94%, P = 0.66).Discussion:The linaclotide regimen was superior to the senna regimen reagrding BP efficacy without reducing tolerability. It can be a promising new option for BP, especially in patients at a high risk of inadequate BP."

Secondary outcomes included the composite components of the primary outcome, major adverse limb events, major adverse cardiac events, and other prespecified clinical and patient reported outcome measures. Serious adverse events were collected up to 30 days after the first revascularisation procedure.Results:Between 29 January 2016 and 31 August 2021, 481 participants were randomised (167 (35%) women, mean age 71.8 years (standard deviation 10.8)). Major amputation or death occurred in 106 of 160 (66%) participants in the PBA±BMS group, 97 of 161 (60%) in the DCBA±BMS group, and 93 of 159 (58%) in the DES group (adjusted hazard ratios: PBA±BMSvDCBA±BMS: 0.84, 97.5% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.16, P=0.22; PBA±BMSvDES: 0.83, 0.60 to 1.15, P=0.20).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39989365,"Background:Catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias, one of the most rapidly growing procedures in cardiac electrophysiology, is associated with magnetic resonance imaging-detected brain lesions in more than half of cases. Although a retrograde aortic approach is conventional, modern tools enable entry through a transseptal approach that may avoid embolization of debris from the arterial system. We sought to test the hypothesis that a transseptal puncture would mitigate brain injury compared with a retrograde aortic approach.Methods:The TRAVERSE trial (Transseptal Versus Retrograde Aortic Ventricular Entry to Reduce Systemic Emboli) was a multicenter randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial. Patients with left ventricular arrhythmias undergoing catheter ablation procedures were randomly assigned to a transseptal puncture approach compared (1:1) with a retrograde aortic approach. The primary outcome was the presence of an acute brain lesion detected by magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary outcomes included clinically manifest complications, procedural efficacy, and 6-month neurocognitive assessments.Results:Among the 62 patients randomly assigned to a retrograde aortic approach with postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging, 28 (45%) exhibited an acute brain lesion compared with 19 of the 69 (28%) of those randomized to a transseptal puncture (P=0.036). No differences in clinically manifest complications or procedural efficacy were observed. More patients in the retrograde aortic arm were categorized as having a high likelihood of cognitive impairment at 6 months (33% compared with 19% of those in the transseptal arm), but substantial loss to follow-up was present.Conclusions:Among patients undergoing left ventricular catheter ablation procedures, a transseptal approach reduced the risk of acute brain lesions by nearly half compared with a retrograde aortic approach without sacrificing safety or efficacy. Given a likely embolic pathogenesis, the brain magnetic resonance imaging findings may reflect a propensity to other organ damage; these findings may extend to other procedures requiring left ventricular entry.Registration:URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier:NCT03946072."

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39970397,"Background:Yellow fever vaccine is highly effective with a single dose, but vaccine supply is limited. The minimum dose requirements for seroconversion remain unknown.Methods:In this double-blind, randomized, noninferiority trial in Uganda and Kenya, we assigned adults with no history of yellow fever vaccination or infection to receive vaccination with the Institut Pasteur de Dakar 17D-204 yellow fever vaccine at a standard dose (13,803 IU) or at a fractional dose of 1000 IU, 500 IU, or 250 IU. The primary outcome was seroconversion at 28 days after vaccination with each fractional dose as compared with the standard dose, evaluated in a noninferiority analysis. Seroconversion was defined as an antibody titer at day 28 that was at least four times as high as the antibody titer before vaccination, as measured by a plaque reduction neutralization test. We conducted noninferiority analyses in the per-protocol and intention-to-treat populations. Noninferiority was shown if the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the incidence of seroconversion between the fractional dose and the standard dose was higher than -10 percentage points.Results:A total of 480 participants underwent randomization (120 participants in each group). The incidence of seroconversion was 98% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94 to 100) with the standard dose. The difference in the incidence of seroconversion between the 1000-IU dose and the standard dose was 0.01 percentage points (95% CI, -5.0 to 5.1) in the intention-to-treat population and -1.9 percentage points (95% CI, -7.0 to 3.2) in the per-protocol population; the corresponding differences between the 500-IU dose and the standard dose were 0.01 percentage points (95% CI, -5.0 to 5.1) and -1.8 percentage points (95% CI, -6.7 to 3.2), and those between the 250-IU dose and the standard dose were -4.4 percentage points (95% CI, -9.4 to 0.7) and -6.7 percentage points (95% CI, -11.7 to 1.6). A total of 111 vaccine-related adverse events were reported: 103 were mild in severity, 7 were moderate, and 1 was severe. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the four groups.Conclusions:A yellow fever vaccination dose as low as 500 IU was noninferior to the standard dose of 13,803 IU for producing seroconversion within 28 days.

The primary composite outcome was the proportion of patients with occluded/stenosed >50% vein graft on coronary computed tomography angiography, or who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention to a vein graft, or died. Secondary outcomes included clinical outcomes and leg wound complications.Results:A total of 902 patients were enrolled with a mean total number of distal vein anastomoses of 2.0 (SD 0.87). The primary endpoint occurred in 90/454 (19.8%) of patients randomized to no-touch and in 107/446 (24.0%) of patients randomized to the conventional technique [difference, -4.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval (CI) -10.1-1.6; P = .15] at a mean follow-up time of 3.5 (SD 0.1) years. The composite of death, myocardial infarction, or repeat revascularization at 4.4 (SD 1.3) years occurred in 57/454 (12.6%) and 44/446 (9.9%) in the no-touch and conventional groups, respectively (hazard ratio 1.3; 95% CI, 0.87-1.93).

The primary endpoint was the restricted mean time to sustained (≥2 days) resolution of 15 COVID-19 symptoms, recorded in participant daily diaries, through day 29 in participants starting treatment within 3 days after symptom onset. Virologic efficacy and safety were assessed.Results:Of 2093 participants, 1888 started treatment within 3 days after symptom onset. Mean time to symptom resolution was 12.5 and 13.1 days with ensitrelvir and placebo, respectively (difference, -0.6 days; 95% confidence interval, -1.38 to 0.19; P = .14). On day 4, ensitrelvir reduced least-squares mean RNA by 0.72 log10 copies/mL more than placebo (95% confidence interval, 0.55-0.90). Among those with positive viral cultures at enrollment, 274/287 (95.5%) ensitrelvir-treated versus 210/280 (75.0%) placebo-treated participants had negative cultures on day 4.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39955119,"Background:In the ESCAPE-NA1 trial, treatment with nerinetide, an eicosapeptide that interferes with post-synaptic density protein 95, was associated with improved functional outcome among patients with acute ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion undergoing endovascular thrombectomy without co-treatment with an intravenous thrombolytic agent. There was no benefit when intravenous thrombolytic agent co-treatment was used. We sought to confirm the clinical benefit of nerinetide in the absence of previous intravenous thrombolytic drug treatment.Methods:In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, done in 77 centres in Canada (16), the USA (16), Germany (21), Italy (four), the Netherlands (three), Norway (four), Switzerland (three), Australia (eight), and Singapore (two), we enrolled patients with acute ischaemic stroke due to anterior circulation large vessel occlusion within 12 h from onset. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with a disabling ischaemic stroke at the time of randomisation (baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score >5), who had been functioning independently in the community (Barthel Index score >90) before the stroke, had Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) greater than 4, and who were not treated with a plasminogen activator. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive intravenous infusion of nerinetide in a single dose of 2·6 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 270 mg, based upon estimated or actual weight (if known) or saline placebo using a real-time, dynamic, internet-based, stratified randomised minimisation procedure. All patients underwent endovascular thrombectomy. The primary outcome was a favourable functional outcome 90 days from randomisation, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2. The analysis was by intention to treat and adjusted for time from stroke onset to randomisation (≤4·5 h [yes or no]), age, sex, baseline NIHSS score, occlusion location, time from qualifying imaging to randomisation, baseline ASPECTS, and region. Secondary outcomes were measures of mortality, worsening of stroke, improved functional independence, and measures of neurological disability. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT04462536.Findings:From Dec 6, 2020, to Jan 31, 2023, 850 patients were assigned to receive nerinetide (n=454) or placebo (n=396). 206 (45%) participants in the nerinetide group and 181 (46%) participants in the placebo group achieved an mRS score of 0-2 at 90 days (odds ratio 0·97, 95% CI 0·72-1·30; p=0·82). Serious adverse events occurred equally between groups.Interpretation:While nerinetide did not improve outcomes in patients with acute ischaemic stroke, it was not associated with excess adverse events.

Physical exercise mitigates several kidney-related pathophysiological pathways, yet its effect on kidney function remains underexplored. We investigated the dose-response effect of physical exercise on kidney function preservation in older adults.Methods:We conducted apost hocanalysis of the Generation 100 Study, a 5-year open-label, randomized, parallel-arm clinical trial conducted from 2012 to 2018 in Trondheim, Norway. All inhabitants aged 70–77 years were invited (n=6966). Main exclusion criteria were dementia; severe, uncontrolled cardiovascular disease or hypertension; or conditions precluding exercise. The control group (n=385) received information on national physical activity recommendations. Intervention groups underwent supervised moderate-intensity continuous training (70% of peak heart rate) for 50 minutes (n=380) twice weekly for 5 years or high-intensity interval training (90% of peak heart rate) for 4 minutes ×4 (n=391) twice weekly for 5 years.

Oxygen uptake increased by 1.8, 2.3, and 3.3 ml/kg per minutes in the control, moderate-intensity, and high-intensity groups, respectively. Rapid eGFR decline occurred in 117 (30%), 108 (28%), and 92 (23%) participants, respectively.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39920395,"Patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have a substantially increased risk for major cardiovascular events and mortality. Increasing physical activity and improving a healthy diet may effectively reduce cardiovascular risk factors; however, the effects are often transient. In a multicenter, 1:1 randomized controlled trial including 502 patients with combined CHD and T2DM (68 ± 8 years; 84% men), we assessed the effects of a home-based telemedicine-supported lifestyle intervention (exercise training, nutritional recommendations and health literacy training) with regular individualized feedback versus usual care. The study met its primary endpoint of reduced glycated hemoglobin after 6 months in favor of the lifestyle intervention group (mean between-group difference in the complete-case analysis (n = 197 and n = 193), -0.13% (95% confidence interval, -0.25 to -0.01), P = 0.04). When individualized feedback and health literacy training were discontinued after 6 months (while other telemedicine tools were maintained), no statistically significant between-group differences were observed at 12 months. At 12 months, 31 patients (6.2%) had a major adverse cardiovascular event (lifestyle intervention, n = 20 (8.0%); usual care, n = 11 (4.4%); P = 0.15), with the main reason being hospitalization for angina or revascularization (lifestyle intervention, n = 15; usual care, n = 8). There were five deaths (lifestyle intervention, n = 2; usual care, n = 3), none of which were categorized as related to the intervention. However, three events that resulted in hospitalization were categorized as potentially related to the intervention (decompensation of heart failure, vertebral disc prolapse and inguinal hernia).

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39913634,"Objective:Previous genetic and clinical analyses have associated lower lipoprotein(a) and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) with greater risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes (NOD). However, PCSK9 inhibitors such as alirocumab lower both lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C without effect on NOD.Research design and methods:In a post hoc analysis of the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial (NCT01663402), we examined the joint prediction of NOD by baseline lipoprotein(a), LDL-C, and insulin (or HOMA-insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]) and their changes with alirocumab treatment. Analyses included 8,107 patients with recent acute coronary syndrome on optimized statin therapy, without diabetes at baseline, assigned to alirocumab or placebo with median follow-up 2.4 years. Splines were estimated from logistic regression models.Results:Lower baseline lipoprotein(a) and higher baseline insulin or HOMA-IR independently predicted 782 cases of NOD; baseline LDL-C did not predict NOD. Alirocumab reduced lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C without affecting insulin or NOD risk (odds ratio [OR] vs. placebo 0.998; 95% CI 0.860-1.158). However, in logistic regression, decreased lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C on alirocumab were independent, opposite predictors of NOD. OR for NOD for 25% and 50% lipoprotein(a) reductions on alirocumab were 1.12 (95% CI 1.01-1.23) and 1.24 (1.02-1.52). OR for NOD for 25% and 50% LDL-C reductions on alirocumab were 0.88 (95% CI 0.80-0.97) and 0.77 (0.64-0.94).Conclusions:Baseline lipoprotein(a) was inversely associated with risk of NOD. Alirocumab-induced reductions of lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C were associated with increased and decreased risk of NOD, respectively, without net effect on NOD. Ongoing trials will determine the impact of larger and longer lipoprotein(a) reductions on NOD."
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39909681,"Background:Concerns about the efficacy and safety of intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in older patients have led to weaker recommendations in the U.S. guidelines for patients ≥75 years of age compared to younger patients. Data are sparse on long-term benefits of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibition in older patients.Objectives:This study aims to assess the long-term benefit of evolocumab among patients aged ≥75 years.Methods:The FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk) trial randomized 27,564 patients who were 18 to 85 years of age with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to evolocumab vs placebo with 2.2 years of median follow-up. In the open-label extension (FOURIER-OLE), 6,635 participants were transitioned to open-label evolocumab for an additional 5-year median follow-up. The primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) was compared based on the original allocation to evolocumab vs placebo stratified by age (<75 vs ≥75 years). Analyses were underpowered for individual components of the composite endpoint. The annualized incidence rates for adverse events of interest were calculated for the OLE population across age groups during the parent FOURIER trial by randomized treatment arm and during the combined parent and FOURIER-OLE studies for patients originally allocated to evolocumab.Results:Of 27,564 patients, 2,526 (9%) were ≥75 years of age at entry into FOURIER (median age: 77 years [Q1-Q3: 76-79 years]). The median follow-up in FOURIER and FOURIER-OLE was 7.1 years (Q1-Q3: 6.7-7.6 years), with a maximum of 8.7 years. Earlier initiation of evolocumab reduced the rate of the primary endpoint at least as well in older (HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.64-0.97) as in younger patients (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.80-0.92; P interaction = 0.43). The absolute risk reductions were 5.4% (95% CI: -2.0% to 12.8%) in older and 2.3% (95% CI: 0.1%-4.5%) in younger patients, leading to numbers needed to treat of 19 and 44, respectively. The annualized incidence rates of safety events generally appeared similar across treatment arms in both age groups.Conclusions:Early initiation of long-term evolocumab provides older patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease cardiovascular benefits at least as good as those observed in younger patients, with a more favorable number needed to treat in older patients for reducing a composite endpoint and no significant safety concerns. These findings may be helpful in guiding future recommendations."

A total of 2735 recurrent stroke events (691 fatal and 2044 nonfatal) and 3242 deaths were recorded. Recurrent stroke was significantly lower in the salt substitute vs regular salt group (rate ratio [RR], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.95; P = .005), with larger effects on hemorrhagic stroke (relative reduction, 30%; P = .002). Death rates were also significantly lower (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82-0.96; P = .003), with larger effects on stroke-related deaths (relative reduction 21%; P = .01). No significant difference was observed for hyperkalemia (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.74-1.38; P = .96).Conclusions and relevance:Results of this cluster trial demonstrate that salt substitution was safe, along with reduced risks of stroke recurrence and death, which underscores large health gains from scaling up this low-cost intervention among patients with stroke.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:NCT02092090."
