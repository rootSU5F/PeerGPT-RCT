Electronic health record screening identified patients with dementia; caregivers confirmed eligibility, including dementia stage.The intervention consisted of monthly calls from a trained nurse or social worker and evidence-based protocols to help caregivers manage patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms, caregiver distress, and palliative care issues (eg, advance care planning, symptoms, and hospice) (n = 99). Usual care caregivers received written dementia resource information and patients received care from usual clinicians (n = 102).The primary outcome was Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) severity score (scores range from 0-36, with higher scores indicating worse patient symptoms). Secondary outcomes included Symptom Management in End-of-Life Dementia scores, caregiver depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8) scores, caregiver distress (NPI-Q distress) scores, and combined ED and hospitalization events. Outcomes were assessed quarterly for 24 months or until patient death.A total of 201 dyads were enrolled (patients were 67.7% female; 43.3% African American; mean [SD] age, 83.6 [7.9] years); 3 dyads withdrew and 83 patients died over the course of the study, with at least 90% of eligible dyads in both groups completing each of the quarterly assessments. For the dementia palliative care vs usual care groups, mean NPI-Q severity scores were 9.92 vs 9.41 at baseline and 9.15 vs 9.39 at 24 months, respectively (between-group difference at 24 months, -0.24 [95% CI, -2.33 to 1.84]).

We aimed to investigate whether treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics in children is inferior to appendicectomy by comparing failure rates for the two treatments.In this pragmatic, multicentre, parallel-group, unmasked, randomised, non-inferiority trial, children aged 5-16 years with suspected non-perforated appendicitis (based on clinical diagnosis with or without radiological diagnosis) were recruited from 11 children's hospitals in Canada, the USA, Finland, Sweden, and Singapore. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the antibiotic or the appendicectomy group with an online stratified randomisation tool, with stratification by sex, institution, and duration of symptoms (≥48 h vs <48 h). The primary outcome was treatment failure within 1 year of random assignment. In the antibiotic group, failure was defined as removal of the appendix, and in the appendicectomy group, failure was defined as a normal appendix based on pathology. In both groups, failure was also defined as additional procedures related to appendicitis requiring general anaesthesia. Interim analysis was done to determine whether inferiority was to be declared at the halfway point. We used a non-inferiority design with a margin of 20%. All outcomes were assessed in participants with 12-month follow-up data. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02687464).Between Jan 20, 2016, and Dec 3, 2021, 936 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to appendicectomy (n=459) or antibiotics (n=477).

We aimed to examine the effect of oral finerenone, compared with placebo, on incident diabetes in the Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients with Heart Failure (FINEARTS-HF) trial.In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 6001 participants with heart failure with New York Heart Association functional class II-IV, left ventricular ejection fraction 40% or higher, evidence of structural heart disease, and elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were randomly assigned to finerenone or placebo, administered orally. Randomisation was performed with concealed allocation. The primary outcome of the trial was the composite of cardiovascular death and total (first and recurrent) heart failure events (ie, heart failure hospitalisation or urgent heart failure visit). In the present analysis, participants with diabetes at baseline (investigator-reported history of diabetes or baseline HbA1c ≥6·5%) were excluded. New-onset diabetes was defined as a HbA1c measurement of 6·5% or higher on two consecutive follow-up visits or new initiation of glucose-lowering therapy. The full-analysis set comprised all participants randomly assigned to study treatment, analysed according to their treatment assignment irrespective of the treatment received (ie, intention to treat). The safety analysis set comprised participants randomly assigned to study treatment who took at least one dose of the investigational product, analysed according to the treatment actually received. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04435626, and is closed to new participants.Between Sept 14, 2020, and Jan 10, 2023, 6001 participants were recruited and randomly assigned to finerenone or placebo. 3222 (53·7%) participants did not have diabetes at baseline and comprised the study population. During a median duration of follow-up of 31·3 months (IQR 21·5-36·3), 115 (7·2%) participants in the finerenone group and 147 (9·1%) in the placebo group developed new-onset diabetes, corresponding to a rate of 3·0 events per 100 person-years (95% CI 2·5-3·6) in the finerenone group and 3·9 events per 100 person-years (3·3-4·6) in the placebo group. Compared with placebo, finerenone significantly reduced the hazard of new-onset diabetes by 24% (hazard ratio [HR] 0·76 [95% CI 0·59-0·97], p=0·026). Fine-Gray competing risk analysis, accounting for the competing risk of death, yielded a similar finding (subdistribution HR 0·75 [0·59-0·96], p=0·024). Results were similar in sensitivity analyses, in which the definition of new-onset diabetes was expanded to include initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment with diabetes as indication, restricted to HbA1c measurements only, and restricted to new initiation of glucose-lowering drugs only (excluding SGLT2 inhibitor treatment). Findings were similar when participants treated with glucose-lowering drugs at baseline were excluded (n=15). The effect of finerenone, compared with placebo, on new-onset diabetes was consistent across key participant subgroups. Seven participants had an adverse event of new diabetes not captured by any of the definitions above.In participants with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction without diabetes, oral finerenone reduced the hazard of new-onset diabetes, representing a meaningful additional clinical benefit of this treatment in these individuals.Bayer.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s).

The primary outcome was the composite of total HF events and cardiovascular death.Among 5,587 patients with an eGFR measurement at both baseline and 1 month, 1,018 (18.2%) experienced a ≥15% decline in eGFR. The proportion of patients experiencing a ≥15% decline in eGFR was 23.0% with finerenone and 13.4% with placebo (OR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.69-2.24; P < 0.001). After adjustment, an eGFR decline was associated with a higher risk of the primary outcome in patients assigned to placebo (adjusted rate ratio: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.20-1.89) but not in those assigned to finerenone (adjusted rate ratio: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.84-1.35; Pinteraction = 0.04). By contrast, the efficacy of finerenone was consistent across the range of change in eGFR from baseline to 1 month (Pinteraction = 0.50 for percent change in eGFR), and safety, including hyperkalemia, was similar regardless of an early eGFR decline.Although an initial decline in eGFR was associated with worse outcomes in patients assigned to placebo, this relationship was not as strong in those treated with finerenone. An early decline in eGFR can be anticipated with finerenone and should not automatically lead to the discontinuation of this disease-modifying therapy (FINEARTS-HF Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients with Heart Failure [NCT04435626]; A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Bline, Parallel-Group, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the efficacy and safety of finerenone on morbidity and mortality in participants With Heart Failure [NYHA II-IV] and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥40% [EudraCT 2020-000306-29]).Copyright © 2025 The Authors.

It has shown therapeutic activity against influenza A and B virus infections in preclinical studies. In this multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of single-dose suraxavir marboxil (40-mg oral dose) in otherwise healthy outpatients aged 5-65 years with uncomplicated influenza unaccompanied by severe issues. From 28 July 2022 to 31 October 2023, 591 outpatients aged 5-65 years with uncomplicated influenza underwent randomization in 46 research centers in China and were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive suraxavir marboxil (40 mg) or placebo within 2 days of symptom onset. The primary outcome was time to alleviation of influenza symptoms (TTAS) (from the start of treatment until body temperature returned to 37.2 °C or less and all seven influenza symptoms (cough, sore throat, headache, nasal congestion, feverishness or chills, muscle or joint pain, and fatigue) resolved for at least 21.5 h) within 15 days by treatment. The secondary endpoints included virological indicators, system and respiratory symptoms, PA variant mutation and adverse events. The median TTAS was significantly shorter in the group that received suraxavir marboxil compared to the placebo group (42.0 h versus 63.0 h, P = 0.002). Suraxavir marboxil was associated with more rapid decrease in viral load from baseline than placebo by 1 day after administration, with a mean change of -2.2 ± 1.3 compared to -1.3 ± 1.7 log10 copies per ml (P < 0.001) in the placebo group. Adverse events were reported in 28.4% (112 of 395) of suraxavir marboxil recipients and 23.3% (45 of 193) of placebo recipients, most of which were mild or moderate. The incidences of PA variants with the I38T mutation in the H1N1pdm and H3N2 subtypes were 0.7% (1 of 138) and 0.9% (2 of 213), respectively. Low acquired drug resistance was observed. In this trial, timely single-dose suraxavir marboxil was effective in shortening TTAS and reducing the influenza viral load in patients aged 5-65 years with uncomplicated influenza safely.

FGR fetuses have a greater risk of stillbirth and perinatal complications and may benefit from serial ultrasound scans to guide early delivery. Abnormal serum angiogenic factors, such as the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1):placental growth factor (PlGF) ratio, have shown potential to more accurately distinguish FGR from SGA, with fewer false positives. This randomized controlled trial compared a management protocol based on the sFlt-1:PlGF with EFW and Doppler ultrasound in avoiding adverse perinatal outcomes in small fetuses after 36 weeks of gestation. A total of 1,088 pregnant women with singleton pregnancies were randomized to either the Doppler-based (control) or the sFlt-1:PlGF-based (intervention) protocol. The primary outcome, neonatal acidosis or Cesarean delivery as a result of abnormal cardiotocography, was assessed in 1,013 participants. The incidence was 10.5% in the intervention group and 10.0% in the control group (absolute difference, 0.53 (-3.21 to 4.26)), with the upper limit of the confidence interval <8.5%, confirming noninferiority. Thus, the sFlt-1:PlGF was noninferior to EFW and Doppler ultrasound in avoiding neonatal acidosis or Cesarean delivery owing to nonreassuring fetal status in small fetuses after 36 weeks (ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04502823 ).© 2025.

In a previous study, we demonstrated the superior protective efficacy of a three-dose regimen of late-arresting genetically attenuated parasites administered by mosquito bite (GA2-MB) compared with early-arresting counterparts (GA1-MB) against a homologous controlled human malaria infection. Encouraged by these results, we explored the potency of a single GA2-MB immunization in a placebo-controlled randomized trial. Primary outcomes were safety and tolerability, time-to-parasitemia and protective efficacy. Humoral and cellular immunological results were considered secondary outcomes. Here we report the safe administration of GA2-MB with no breakthrough malaria and sterile protection in nine of ten participants at 6 weeks after a single immunization with 50 GA2-infected mosquitoes, compared with none of five mock-immunized participants, against a homologous controlled human malaria infection. Immunization increased circulating Pf-specific polyfunctional effector memory CD4+ T cells coexpressing tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-2. This unprecedented 90% protective efficacy after a single low-dose immunization holds great promise for the potency of GA2 immunization. Future studies should demonstrate whether GA2 is similarly efficacious in pre-exposed populations and whether the favorable safety profile reported here holds up in larger groups.

In this multicenter, randomized trial, we evaluated the effects of combined endurance and resistance training over 12 months in patients with HFpEF. The primary endpoint was a modified Packer score, including all-cause mortality, hospitalizations classified as potentially related to heart failure or exercise and changes in peak oxygen consumption (   V ̇  O 2    ), diastolic function (E/e'), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and global self-assessment (GSA). In total, 322 patients (mean age, 70 years; 192 females (59.6%) and 130 males (40.4%)) were randomized (1:1) to ET or usual care (UC). At 12 months, the modified Packer score showed an improvement in 33 ET patients (20.5%) and in 13 UC patients (8.1%) and showed a worsening in 69 ET patients (42.9%) and in 71 UC patients (44.1%) (Kendall's tau-b = -0.073, P = 0.17). Although the primary endpoint was not met, clinically relevant differences favoring the ET group as compared to the UC group were observed for the following secondary endpoints: changes in peak   V ̇  O 2    (mean difference, 1.3 ml kg-1 min-1 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4-2.1)) and NYHA class (odds ratio = 7.77 (95% CI: 3.73-16.21)). No significant between-group differences were observed for other secondary endpoints, including change in E/e', change in GSA, time to cardiovascular hospitalization or all-cause mortality. In conclusion, 1 year of combined endurance and resistance ET did not result in a significantly better modified Packer score, but it did result in improvements in important clinical parameters, such as peak   V ̇  O 2    and NYHA class, as compared to UC.

BMI (kg/m2) was examined using World Health Organization categories, namely, underweight/normal weight (<25.0 kg/m2; n = 1,306); overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m2; n = 1,990); obesity class I (30.0-34.9 kg/m2; n = 1,546); obesity class II (35.0-39.9 kg/m2; n = 751); and obesity class III (≥40 kg/m2; n = 395). The primary outcome was cardiovascular death and total worsening HF events.Data on baseline BMI were available for 5,988 patients (median: 29.2 kg/m2; Q1-Q3: 25.5-33.6 kg/m2). Compared with patients who were underweight/normal weight, those with obesity class II or III had a higher risk of the primary outcome (underweight/normal weight, reference; overweight, unadjusted rate ratio: 0.96 [95% CI: 0.81-1.15]; obesity class I: 1.04 [95% CI: 0.86-1.26]; obesity class II-III: 1.26 [95% CI: 1.03-1.54]). The effect of finerenone on the primary outcome did not vary by baseline BMI (underweight/normal weight, rate ratio: 0.80 [95% CI: 0.62-1.04]; overweight: 0.91 [95% CI: 0.72-1.15]; obesity class I: 0.92 [95% CI: 0.72-1.19]; obesity class II-III: 0.67 [95% CI: 0.50-0.89]; Pinteraction = 0.32). However, when BMI was examined as a continuous variable, the beneficial effect of finerenone seemed to be greater in those with a higher BMI (Pinteraction = 0.005). A similar pattern was observed for total worsening HF events. Consistent effects across baseline BMI were observed for cardiovascular and all-cause death and improvement in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores.In patients with HF with mildly reduced/preserved ejection fraction, the beneficial effects of finerenone on clinical events and symptoms were consistent, irrespective of BMI at baseline, possibly with a greater effect on the primary outcome in patients with higher BMI.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of filgotinib, an oral Janus kinase 1 preferential inhibitor, for treating Crohn's disease.This phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 371 centres in 39 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease for at least 3 months before enrolment. Patients were enrolled into one of two induction studies on the basis of their experience with biological agents (induction study A included biologic-naive and later biologic-experienced patients and induction study B included biologic-experienced patients). In both induction studies, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1), using an interactive web response system, to receive oral filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg, or placebo once daily for 11 weeks. Patients who received filgotinib and had two-item patient-reported outcome (PRO2) clinical remission or an endoscopic response at week 10 were re-randomised (2:1) to receive their induction dose or placebo orally, once daily to the end of week 58 in the maintenance study. Co-primary endpoints were PRO2 clinical remission and an endoscopic response at week 10 (induction studies) and week 58 (maintenance study). PRO2 clinical remission was defined as an abdominal pain subscore of not more than 1 and a liquid or very soft stool frequency subscore of not more than 3 (from eDiary data) and endoscopic response was defined as a reduction of at least 50% in Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's disease from induction baseline (from central reading of endoscopy). For the induction studies, efficacy was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug. For the maintenance study, efficacy was assessed in all patients from either filgotinib treatment group in the induction studies who reached PRO2 clinical remission or an endoscopic response at week 10, and who were re-randomised and received at least one dose of study drug in the maintenance study. Patients who received placebo throughout the induction and maintenance studies were not included in the full analysis set for the maintenance study. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is complete and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02914561.Between Oct 31, 2016, and Nov 11, 2022, 2634 patients were screened, of whom 1372 were enrolled (induction study A: n=707, induction study B: n=665, and maintenance study: n=481). There were 346 (49%) women and 358 (51%) men in induction study A, 356 (54%) women and 303 (46%) men in induction study B, and 242 women (51%) and 236 men (49%) in the maintenance study. Significantly more patients had PRO2 clinical remission at week 10 with filgotinib 200 mg than with placebo in induction study B (29·7% vs 17·9%, difference 11·9%; 95% CI 3·7 to 20·2, p=0·0039) but not induction study A (32·9% vs 25·7%, 6·9%; -1·4 to 15·2, p=0·0963); there was no significant difference for endoscopic response (induction study A: 23·9% vs 18·1%, difference 5·5%; 95% CI -2·0 to 12·9, p=0·1365; induction study B: 11·9% vs 11·4%, 0·1%; -6·5 to 6·6, p=0·9797). At week 58, both co-primary endpoints were reported in greater proportions of patients who received filgotinib 200 mg than in those who received placebo (PRO2 clinical remission: 43·8% vs 26·4%, difference 16·8%; 95% CI 2·0 to 31·6, p=0·0382; endoscopic response: 30·4% vs 9·4%, difference 20·6%; 95% CI 8·2 to 33·1, p=0·0038). Co-primary endpoints were not met for filgotinib 100 mg in any study. In the induction studies, the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; ≥5% of patients in any group) were abdominal pain; arthralgia; an exacerbation, flare, or worsening of Crohn's disease; headache; nasopharyngitis; nausea; and pyrexia. In the maintenance study, the most frequently reported TEAEs (≥5% of patients in any filgotinib or associated placebo group) were those reported in the induction studies (except for headache) and abdominal distension, upper abdominal pain, anaemia, and flatulence. Serious TEAEs were reported in 49 patients in induction study A (18 [8%]) of 222 patients in the filgotinib 200 mg group, 16 [7%] of 245 patients in the filgotinib 100 mg group, and 15 [6%] of 237 patients in the placebo group), 81 patients in induction study B (19 [9%] of 202 patients in the filgotinib 200 mg group, 36 [16%] of 228 patients in the filgotinib 100 mg group, and 26 [11%] of 229 patients in the placebo group), and 49 patients in the maintenance study (13 [11%] of 118 patients in the filgotinib 200 mg-filgotinib 200 mg group, five [9%] of 56 patients in the filgotinib 200 mg-placebo group, 14 [13%] of 104 patients in the filgotinib 100 mg-filgotinib 100 mg group, three [5%] of 55 patients in the filgotinib 100 mg-placebo group, and 14 [10%] of 145 patients in the placebo-placebo group). No deaths were reported during the induction and maintenance studies.Filgotinib 200 mg did not meet the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and an endoscopic response at week 10, but did meet the co-primary endpoints at week 58. Filgotinib treatment was well tolerated, and no new safety signals were reported.Galapagos.Copyright © 2025 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

No approved therapies for patients younger than 6 years old currently exist. The phase 3, open-label VENTURE trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of setmelanotide in patients aged 2-5 years with POMC or LEPR deficiency or BBS.This phase 3, open-label, multicentre trial, conducted across six sites in the USA, the UK, Spain, and Australia, enrolled eligible patients aged 2-5 years who had hyperphagia and obesity due to biallelic POMC (including PCSK1) or LEPR variants or genetically confirmed BBS. Open-label subcutaneous setmelanotide was administered once daily for 52 weeks, starting at 0·5 mg with doses increasing every 2 weeks in 0·5 mg increments until reaching the maximum dose based on weight. The co-primary endpoints at week 52 were the percentage of patients reaching a 0·2-point decrease or greater in BMI Z score (a statistical measure used to assess BMI in paediatric patients considering a patient's BMI and comparing it to reference values for the same age and sex) and mean percent change in BMI. Additional endpoints measured safety, hunger, weight-related outcomes, and caregiver burden. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04966741) and is complete.Between March 8, 2022, and Sept 18, 2023, 13 patients were screened at the six sites, and 12 patients were enrolled in the study (seven with POMC or LEPR and five with BBS); one patient with BBS was excluded as their BMI was not at the 97th percentile or above. Of the 12 patients enrolled, most were male (seven [58%] vs five [42%] for female) and the mean age was 3·6 years (SD 0·9). 11 patients completed the trial. Ten (83%) of the 12 overall participants reached a 0·2-point reduction or more in BMI Z score per WHO methodology at week 52 (95% CI 58·7-99·8). The mean percent change in BMI from baseline at week 52 was -18% (SD 13) in the overall safety population. Mean percent change in BMI at week 52 was -26% (SD 11) in patients with POMC or LEPR deficiency and -10% (9) in patients with BBS. Mean reductions in secondary endpoints of BMI Z score (3·4 [2·5]) and percent of the BMI 95th percentile (32·5 [22·9]) were seen at Week 52. 91% of caregivers reported that patients were less hungry than at baseline. All adverse events were mild or moderate; skin hyperpigmentation, vomiting, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and injection site reactions were most common. No serious adverse events or adverse events leading to study discontinuation or death were reported.To our knowledge this is the first trial of setmelanotide in patients younger than 6 years old. These results support the benefit of the drug as an early intervention to manage obesity in this population.Rhythm Pharmaceuticals.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

In part A, healthy participants were enrolled in six cohorts and randomly assigned (3:1) using a block randomisation algorithm to receive single ascending doses of IMU-856 ranging from 10 mg to 160 mg or matching placebo. Based on the results from part A, three doses were selected for part B to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of IMU-856 once daily for 14 days using the same randomisation algorithm. Part C enrolled patients with well controlled coeliac disease. Participants were centrally randomised 1:1:1 using an interactive web response system to receive either low dose or high dose of IMU-856 or placebo once daily for 28 days that included a 15-day gluten challenge starting on day 14. The primary objective was safety and tolerability of IMU-856. Safety analyses were done on all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. The trial is registered with the ANZCTR registry (ACTRN12620000901909).Between July 27, 2020, and Oct 28, 2022, 71 healthy participants were enrolled in part A and B and assigned to either placebo (n=19) or IMU-856 (n=52).

TEAEs were mainly mild in severity. In part C, TEAEs occured in 26 (90%) of 29 patients on any dose of IMU-856 and ten (71%) of 14 receiving placebo; the most common TEAEs with any dose of IMU-856 by preferred term were headache (13 [45%] of 29), nausea (nine [31%]), diarrhoea (eight [28%]), and abdominal distension (seven [24%]). Two serious adverse events occurred with IMU-856 treatment (one in part B [bacterial myocarditis] and one in part C [biliary colic]), both of which were unrelated to IMU-856. No dose-limiting toxicities, systematic safety laboratory changes, or deaths occurred during the study. In part C, mean decrease in villous height was -20·9 μm (SD 34·8) among patients who received IMU-856 80 mg, -22·5 μm (51·1) among those who received IMU-856 160 mg, and -60·3 μm (52·2) among those who received placebo.The favourable safety profile, along with preliminary activity, suggests that IMU-856 should be studied in future trials of coeliac disease.Immunic Australia.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is a patient-reported outcome measure that enables evaluation of the effect of HF and the impact of new therapies on health status in patients with HF.This prespecified analysis of FINEARTS-HF (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure) assessed the efficacy and safety of finerenone according to baseline KCCQ Total Symptom Score (TSS) and the effect of finerenone on KCCQ-TSS.FINEARTS-HF tested the efficacy of the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) finerenone, compared with placebo, in patients with HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction/preserved ejection fraction. The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death and total worsening HF events. The KCCQ was completed by patients at randomization and at 6, 9, and 12 months after randomization. Change in KCCQ-TSS was a key secondary endpoint. Patients were stratified by KCCQ-TSS tertiles at baseline. The association between KCCQ tertile and clinical outcomes was evaluated using semiparametric proportional-rates models for total events and Cox models for time-to-first-event data, and the effects of finerenone vs placebo on the primary endpoint were assessed across tertiles of KCCQ-TSS.Of the 6,001 participants in FINEARTS-HF, 5,986 (99.8%) had baseline KCCQ-TSS recorded (median score 69.8 of a possible 100; higher score = better health status). Lower (worse) KCCQ-TSS was associated with a higher risk of the primary endpoint. Finerenone, compared with placebo, reduced the risk of the primary endpoint across the range of KCCQ-TSS: tertile 1 (score 0-<57): RR: 0.82 (95% CI: 0.68-1.00); tertile 2 (57-<81): 0.88 (95% CI: 0.70-1.11); tertile 3 (81-100): 0.88 (95% CI: 0.69-1.14) (Pinteraction = 0.89). Compared with placebo, finerenone significantly improved KCCQ-TSS from baseline with a mean difference at 12 months of 1.62 points (95% CI: 0.69-2.56 points) (P < 0.001). Numerically fewer finerenone-treated patients experienced clinically meaningful deterioration, and more had improvements in KCCQ-TSS.Finerenone significantly reduced HF events and improved health status in patients with HF and mildly reduced ejection fraction/preserved ejection fraction across the spectrum of KCCQ-TSS at baseline.

We previously demonstrated that the endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) atrasentan reduced insulin resistance in T2D. In this study, we compared the effect of atrasentan on insulin resistance across different phenotypic clusters of patients with T2D.We performed a post hoc analysis of the SONAR trial, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the ERA atrasentan in patients with T2D and CKD. Patients were stratified into four previously identified phenotypic clusters: severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD), severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD), mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD) and mild age-related diabetes (MARD). Changes in insulin resistance, assessed by HOMA-IR, were compared between the phenotypic clusters using a mixed effects model.In total, 931 patients were included in the analysis. In the overall population, atrasentan compared to placebo reduced HOMA-IR by 12.9% [95%CI 3.5,21.4]. This effect of atrasentan was more pronounced in clusters characterized by insulin resistance or deficiency: (SIRD cluster 26.2% [95% CI 3.8,43.3] and SIDD cluster 18.5% [95%CI -3.8,35.9]), although the latter did not reach statistical significance.

In this prespecified analysis, we also report effects of finerenone on: 1) sustained ≥57% eGFR decline or kidney failure; 2) eGFR slope; and 3) changes in urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR).Among 6,001 participants, mean baseline eGFR was 62 ± 20 mL/min/1.73 m2; 48% had eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Overall, 5,797 had baseline UACR data (median: 18 mg/g [Q1-Q3: 7-67 mg/g]). Over 2.6 years median follow-up, the incidence of the composite kidney outcome (≥50% eGFR decline or kidney failure) was numerically, but nonsignificantly, higher for finerenone vs placebo (75 vs 55 events; HR: 1.33; 95% CI: 0.94-1.89). Similar results were observed for the composite of ≥57% eGFR decline or kidney failure (41 vs 31 events; HR: 1.28; 95% CI: 0.80-2.05), although the overall event frequency was relatively low. During the first 3 months, finerenone led to an acute decline in eGFR of -2.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI: -3.4 to -2.4 mL/min/1.73 m2) but did not alter chronic (from 3 months) eGFR slope (+0.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year; 95% CI: -0.1 to 0.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year), vs placebo. The difference in total slope was -0.7 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year (95% CI: -0.9 to -0.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year.). Finerenone reduced UACR by 30% (95% CI: 25%-34%) over 6 months vs placebo, an effect that persisted throughout follow-up. Finerenone reduced the risk of new-onset of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria by 24% (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.68-0.83) and 38% (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.53-0.73), respectively.In FINEARTS-HF, a population at low risk of adverse kidney outcomes, finerenone did not significantly modify the kidney composite outcomes. Finerenone led to a greater reduction in initial eGFR, but did not result in a significant difference in chronic eGFR slope vs placebo. Finerenone led to early and sustained reductions in albuminuria and reduced the risk of new-onset micro- and macroalbuminuria.

In subgroup analyses, TTVR+OMT improved health status to a greater extent among patients with torrential or massive TR vs severe TR (treatment effect 23.3 vs 22.6 vs 11.3; interaction P = 0.049).

Patients in the US cohort were younger, more predominantly male, had a lower prevalence of atrial fibrillation, and had a higher prevalence of bicuspid aortic valve, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease compared with the OUS cohort. In the main trial, the incidence of stroke within 72 hours after TAVR or before discharge did not differ significantly between the CEP group and the control group, and there was no interaction by geographic region. In this post hoc analysis, patients treated with CEP in the US cohort exhibited a 50% relative risk reduction for overall stroke and a 73% relative risk reduction for disabling stroke compared to TAVR alone; a treatment effect on stroke risk reduction was not observed in the OUS cohort.The PROTECTED TAVR trial could not show that the use of CEP had a significant effect on the incidence of periprocedural stroke during TAVR. Although there was no significant interaction by geographic region, this exploratory post hoc analysis suggests a trend toward greater stroke reduction in the US cohort but not in the OUS cohort.

This is a fully remote, multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized superiority trial of 10-week home-based tDCS in MDD. Participants were 18 years or older, with MDD in current depressive episode of at least moderate severity as measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (mean = 19.07 ± 2.73). A total of 174 participants (120 women, 54 men) were randomized to active (n = 87, mean age = 37.09 ± 11.14 years) or sham (n = 87, mean age = 38.32 ± 10.92 years) treatment. tDCS consisted of five sessions per week for 3 weeks then three sessions per week for 7 weeks in a 10-week trial, followed by a 10-week open-label phase. Each session lasted 30 min; the anode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the cathode over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (active tDCS 2 mA and sham tDCS 0 mA, with brief ramp up and down to mimic active stimulation). As the primary outcome, depressive symptoms showed significant improvement when measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale: active 9.41 ± 6.25 point improvement (10-week mean = 9.58 ± 6.02) and sham 7.14 ± 6.10 point improvement (10-week mean = 11.66 ± 5.96) (95% confidence interval = 0.51-4.01, P = 0.012). There were no differences in discontinuation rates. In summary, a 10-week home-based tDCS treatment with remote supervision in MDD showed high efficacy, acceptability and safety.

Patients were randomly allocated via block randomisation using interactive response technology stratified by infection type in a 2:1 ratio to aztreonam-avibactam (with metronidazole for complicated intra-abdominal infection) or meropenem with or without colistin for 5-14 days for complicated intra-abdominal infection or 7-14 days for HAP-VAP. The primary endpoint was clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit (within 3 days before or after day 28) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Secondary endpoints included 28-day mortality in the ITT population and safety in patients in the ITT population who received study drug (safety analysis set). No formal hypothesis testing was planned. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03329092) and EudraCT (2017-002742-68) and is complete.Between April 5, 2018, and Feb 23, 2023, we screened 461 patients. 422 patients were enrolled and randomly allocated (282 in the aztreonam-avibactam group and 140 in the meropenem group, forming the ITT analysis set), of whom ten patients (seven in the aztreonam-avibactam group and three in the meropenem group) were randomly allocated but did not receive study treatment. 271 (64%) of 422 patients had at least one Gram-negative pathogen from an adequate specimen identified at baseline. The most frequent baseline pathogens were Enterobacterales (252 [93%] of 271). Overall, 19 (24%) of 80 isolates tested for carbapenemases were carbapenemase-positive (serine, metallo-β-lactamase, or both). 193 (68·4%) of 282 patients in the aztreonam-avibactam group and 92 (65·7%) of 140 in the meropenem group had clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit (treatment difference 2·7% [95% CI -6·6 to 12·4]). For patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection, the adjudicated clinical cure rate was 76·4% (159 of 208) for the aztreonam-avibactam group and 74·0% (77 of 104) for the meropenem group. Cure rates in patients with HAP-VAP were 45·9% (34 of 74) for aztreonam-avibactam and 41·7% (15 of 36) for meropenem. 28-day all-cause mortality rates were 4% (12 of 282) for aztreonam-avibactam and 7% (ten of 140) for meropenem; in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection, mortality was 2% (four of 208) and 3% (three of 104) for aztreonam-avibactam and meropenem, respectively, and in patients with HAP-VAP, mortality was 11% (eight of 74) and 19% (seven of 36), respectively. Aztreonam-avibactam was generally well tolerated, and safety findings were consistent with the known safety profile of aztreonam monotherapy. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events in the aztreonam-avibactam group.These phase 3 efficacy and safety data provide support for aztreonam-avibactam as a potential therapeutic option for complicated intra-abdominal infection or HAP-VAP caused by Gram-negative bacteria.Pfizer.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

Other secondary efficacy endpoints at week 52 (between-group differences (95% CI)) included: Time to Rise (-0.64 (-1.06, -0.23)), 10-meter Walk/Run (-0.42 (-0.71, -0.13)), stride velocity 95th centile (0.10 (0.00, 0.19)), 100-meter Walk/Run (-3.29 (-8.28, 1.70)), time to ascend 4 steps (-0.36 (-0.71, -0.01)), PROMIS Mobility and Upper Extremity (0.05 (-0.08, 0.19); -0.04 (-0.24, 0.17)) and number of NSAA skills gained/improved (0.19 (-0.67, 1.06)). In total, 674 adverse events were recorded with delandistrogene moxeparvovec and 514 with placebo. There were no deaths, discontinuations or clinically significant complement-mediated adverse events; 7 patients (11.1%) experienced 10 treatment-related serious adverse events. Delandistrogene moxeparvovec did not lead to a significant improvement in NSAA score at week 52. Some of the secondary endpoints numerically favored treatment, although no statistical significance can be claimed. Safety was manageable and consistent with previous delandistrogene moxeparvovec trials. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05096221.© 2024.

In FINEARTS-HF (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure), the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and total worsening HF events in patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. We examined the effect of finerenone according to LVEF in FINEARTS-HF.FINEARTS-HF was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial examining the efficacy and safety of finerenone in patients with HF and LVEF ≥40%. The treatment effect of finerenone was examined in prespecified analyses according to LVEF categories (<50%, ≥50% to <60%, and ≥60%) and with LVEF as a continuous variable. The primary outcome was a composite of total (first and recurrent) worsening HF events and cardiovascular death.Baseline LVEF data were available for 5993 of the 6001 participants in FINEARTS-HF. Mean and median LVEF were 53±8% and 53% (interquartile range, 46%-58%), respectively. LVEF was <50% in 2172 (36%), between 50% and <60% in 2674 (45%), and ≥60% in 1147 (19%). Patients with higher LVEF were older, were more commonly female, were less likely to have a history of coronary artery disease, and more frequently had a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease compared with those with a lower LVEF. Finerenone reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and total HF events consistently across LVEF categories (LVEF <50% rate ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.68-1.03]; LVEF ≥50% to <60% rate ratio, 0.80 [0.66-0.97]; and LVEF ≥60% rate ratio, 0.94 [0.70-1.25]; Pinteraction=0.70). There was no modification of the benefit of finerenone across the range of LVEF when analyzed as a continuous variable (Pinteraction=0.28). There was a similar consistent effect of finerenone on reducing the total number of worsening HF events (continuous Pinteraction=0.26).In patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction, finerenone reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and worsening HF events, irrespective of LVEF.URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT04435626.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone have both been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in this population, but the effects of their combined use are not known.FINEARTS-HF (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of finerenone in patients with HF and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥40%. Baseline SGLT2i use was a prespecified subgroup. The primary outcome was a composite of total (first and recurrent) worsening HF events and cardiovascular death. We first assessed for evidence of treatment heterogeneity on the basis of baseline SGLT2i use. We further examined SGLT2i uptake during the trial and evaluated the treatment effects of finerenone accounting for baseline and during-trial use of SGLT2i in time-varying analyses.Among 6001 participants, 817 (13.6%) were treated with an SGLT2i at baseline. During 2.6 years median follow-up, treatment with finerenone similarly reduced the risk of the primary outcome in participants treated with an SGLT2i (rate ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.60-1.16]) and without an SGLT2i at baseline (rate ratio, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.74-0.98]; Pinteraction=0.76). In follow-up, 980 participants initiated SGLT2i, which was less frequent in the finerenone arm compared with placebo (17.7% versus 20.1%; hazard ratio, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.76-0.97]). Time-updated analyses accounting for baseline and subsequent use of SGLT2i did not meaningfully alter the treatment effects of finerenone on the primary end point.The treatment benefits of the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone were observed irrespective of concomitant use of an SGLT2i. These data suggest that the combined use of SGLT2i and a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist may provide additive protection against cardiovascular events in patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT04435626.",10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.072055,NCT04435626,pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39340828,NA,NA,2025/02/02,,,

The global Pivotal study has shown the EV ICD system to be safe and effective through 6 months, but long-term experience has yet to be published. Our aim was to report the performance and safety of the EV ICD system throughout the study.The EV ICD Pivotal study was a prospective, global, single-arm, premarket clinical study. Individuals with a Class I or IIa indication for a single-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator per guidelines were enrolled. Freedom from major system- or procedure-related complications and appropriate and inappropriate therapy rates were assessed through 3 years with the Kaplan-Meier method. ATP success was calculated from simple proportions.An implantation was attempted in 316 patients (25.3% female; 53.8±13.1 years of age; 81.6% primary prevention; left ventricular ejection fraction, 38.9±15.4%). Of 299 patients with a successful implantation, 24 experienced 82 spontaneous arrhythmic episodes that were appropriately treated with ATP only (38, 46.3%), shock only (34, 41.5%), or both (10, 12.2%) for a Kaplan-Meier-estimated rate of first any appropriate therapy of 9.2% at 3 years. ATP was successful in 77.1% (37/48) of episodes, and ATP use significantly increased from discharge to last follow-up visit (P<0.0001). Shock therapy was successful in 100% (27/27) of discrete, spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias. The inappropriate shock rates at 1 and 3 years were 9.8% and 17.5%, respectively, with P-wave oversensing the predominant cause. No major intraprocedural complications were reported, and the estimated freedom from system- or procedure-related major complications was 91.9% at 1 year and 89.0% at 3 years. The most common major complications were lead dislodgement (10 events; n=9 patients, 2.8%), postoperative wound or device pocket infection (n=8, 2.5%), and device inappropriate shock delivery (n=4, 1.3%). Twenty-four system revisions were performed as a result of major complications related to the EV ICD system or procedure.From implantation to study completion, the EV ICD Pivotal study demonstrated that a single integrated system with an extravascular lead placed in the substernal space maintains high ATP success, effective defibrillation, and a consistent safety profile.URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT04060680.",10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.071795,NCT04060680,pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39327797,NA,NA,2025/02/02,,,

The PB+Ex intervention included 12 weeks of meals, exercise sessions and group classes. Primary outcomes were glycaemic control (HbA1c, glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR) and glucose-lowering medication use. Secondary outcomes included lipids, blood pressure, heart rate and C-reactive protein. Only lab analysts were blinded.Compared with SMC (n=90 randomised; n=70 analysed), the PB+Ex (n=79 randomised; n=66 analysed) intervention decreased HbA1c by an additional 14 mmol/mol (1.3%) at week 12 (-22 vs -7 mmol/mol [-2.0% vs -0.7%]; p<0.0001) and 8 mmol/mol (0.7%) at week 24 (-16 vs -8 mmol/mol [-1.4% vs -0.7%]; p=0.01). Concomitantly, 63% of medicated PB+Ex participants reduced their glucose-lowering medications (vs 24%; p=0.006), and 23% of PB+Ex participants with a baseline HbA1c <75 mmol/mol (<9%) achieved remission. Additionally, the PB+Ex intervention reduced weight (-2.7 kg; p<0.0001), C-reactive protein (-11 nmol/l; p=0.005) and cardiovascular medication use compared with SMC. At intermediate timepoints, it improved glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, cholesterol, triglycerides and heart rate, but not at week 24.A whole-food, plant-based lifestyle intervention was more effective for improving glycaemic control than SMC. It also reduced the need for diabetes and cardiovascular medications and induced diabetes remission in some participants.

Adolescents are a sensitive population who would benefit from a prophylactic vaccine. This study assessed the immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine VLA1553 in adolescents in Brazil. With an overall trial duration of 12 months, we now report data on safety and immunogenicity over a period of 28 days after vaccination.In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, adolescents aged 12 to <18 years were recruited. The trial was performed at ten trial sites across Brazil. Eligible participants were generally healthy. The main exclusion criteria comprised immune-mediated or chronic arthritis or arthralgia, a known or suspected defect of the immune system, or any live vaccine received within the 4 weeks before trial vaccination. Randomisation was stratified by baseline serostatus in a 2:1 ratio to receive VLA1553 (at a dose of 1 × 104 TCID50 per 0·5 mL [ie, 50% tissue culture infectious dose]) or placebo. VLA1553 or placebo was administered intramuscularly as a single-dose immunisation on day 1. The primary endpoint was the proportion of baseline seronegative participants with chikungunya virus neutralising antibody levels of 150 or more in μPRNT50 (a micro plaque reduction neutralisation test), which was considered a surrogate of protection. The safety analysis included all participants receiving a trial vaccination. Immunogenicity analyses were performed in a subset. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04650399.Between Feb 14, 2022, and March 14, 2023, 754 participants received a trial vaccination (502 received VLA1553 and 252 received placebo) with a per-protocol population of 351 participants for immunogenicity analyses (303 in the VLA1553 group and 48 in the placebo group). In participants who were seronegative at baseline, VLA1553 induced seroprotective chikungunya virus neutralising antibody levels in 247 of 250 (98·8%, 95% CI 96·5-99·8) participants 28 days after vaccination. In seropositive participants, the baseline seroprotection rate of 96·2% increased to 100% after vaccination with VLA1553. Most (365 [93%] of 393) adverse events were of mild or moderate intensity, VLA1553 was generally well tolerated. When compared with placebo, participants exposed to VLA1553 had a significantly higher frequency of related adverse events (351 [69·9%] of 502 vs 121 [48·0%] of 252; p<0·0001), mostly headache, myalgia, fatigue, and fever. Among four reported serious adverse events (three in the VLA1553 group and one in the placebo group), one was classified as possibly related to VLA1553: a high-grade fever. Among 20 adverse events of special interest (ie, symptoms suggesting chikungunya-like disease), 16 were classified as related to trial vaccination (15 in the VLA1553 group and one in the placebo group), with severe symptoms reported in four participants (fever, headache, or arthralgia). 17 adverse events of special interest resolved within 1 week. Among 85 participants with arthralgia (68 in the VLA1553 group and 17 in the placebo group), eight adolescents had short-lived (range 1-5 days), mostly mild recurring episodes (seven in the VLA1553 group and one in the placebo group). The median duration of arthralgia was 1 day (range 1-5 days). The frequency of injection site adverse events for VLA1553 was higher than in the placebo group (161 [32%] vs 62 [25%]), but rarely severe (two [<1%] in the VLA1553 group and one [<1%] in the placebo group). After administration of VLA1553, there was a significantly lower frequency of solicited adverse events in participants who were seropositive at baseline compared with those who were seronegative (53% vs 74%; p<0·0001) including headache, fatigue, fever, and arthralgia.VLA1553 was generally safe and induced seroprotective titres in almost all vaccinated adolescents with favourable safety data in adolescents who were seropositive at baseline. The data support the use of VLA1553 for the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus among adolescents and in endemic areas.Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation and EU Horizon 2020.For the Portuguese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

Asundexian, an activated factor XI (XIa) inhibitor, is an oral anticoagulant that may prevent strokes with less bleeding.In a phase 3, international, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation in a 1:1 ratio to receive asundexian at a dose of 50 mg once daily or standard-dose apixaban. The primary efficacy objective was to determine whether asundexian is at least noninferior to apixaban for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety objective was to determine whether asundexian is superior to apixaban with respect to major bleeding events.A total of 14,810 randomly assigned patients were included in the intention-to-treat population. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 73.9±7.7 years, 35.2% were women, 18.6% had chronic kidney disease, 18.2% had a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, 16.8% had received oral anticoagulants for no more than 6 weeks, and the mean CHA2DS2-VASc score (range, 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of stroke) was 4.3±1.3. The trial was stopped prematurely at the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee. Stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 98 patients (1.3%) assigned to receive asundexian and in 26 (0.4%) assigned to receive apixaban (hazard ratio, 3.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.46 to 5.83). Major bleeding occurred in 17 patients (0.2%) who received asundexian and in 53 (0.7%) who received apixaban (hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.55). The incidence of any adverse event appeared to be similar in the two groups.Among patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke, treatment with asundexian at a dose of 50 mg once daily was associated with a higher incidence of stroke or systemic embolism than treatment with apixaban in the period before the trial was stopped prematurely. There were fewer major bleeding events with asundexian than with apixaban during this time.

The disorder is associated with the risk of recurrent acute pancreatitis. Plozasiran is a small interfering RNA that reduces hepatic production of apolipoprotein C-III and circulating triglycerides.In a phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 75 patients with persistent chylomicronemia (with or without a genetic diagnosis) to receive subcutaneous plozasiran (25 mg or 50 mg) or placebo every 3 months for 12 months. The primary end point was the median percent change from baseline in the fasting triglyceride level at 10 months. Key secondary end points were the percent change in the fasting triglyceride level from baseline to the mean of values at 10 months and 12 months, changes in the fasting apolipoprotein C-III level from baseline to 10 months and 12 months, and the incidence of acute pancreatitis.At baseline, the median triglyceride level was 2044 mg per deciliter. At 10 months, the median change from baseline in the fasting triglyceride level (the primary end point) was -80% in the 25-mg plozasiran group, -78% in the 50-mg plozasiran group, and -17% in the placebo group (P<0.001). The key secondary end points showed better results in the plozasiran groups than in the placebo group, including the incidence of acute pancreatitis (odds ratio, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.94; P = 0.03). The risk of adverse events was similar across groups; the most common adverse events were abdominal pain, nasopharyngitis, headache, and nausea. Severe and serious adverse events were less common with plozasiran than with placebo.

The acoustic-based coronary artery disease (CAD)-score has superior rule-out capabilities when added to pre-test probability (PTP). FILTER-SCAD tested whether providing a CAD-score and PTP to cardiologists was superior to PTP alone in limiting testing.At six Danish and Swedish outpatient clinics, patients with suspected new-onset CCS were randomized to either standard diagnostic examination (SDE) with PTP, or SDE plus CAD-score, and cardiologists provided with corresponding recommended diagnostic flowcharts. The primary endpoint was cumulative number of diagnostic tests at one year and key safety endpoint major adverse cardiac events (MACE).In total, 2008 patients (46% male, median age 63 years) were randomized from October 2019 to September 2022. When randomized to CAD-score (n = 1002), it was successfully measured in 94.5%. Overall, 13.5% had PTP ≤ 5%, and 39.5% had CAD-score ≤ 20. Testing was deferred in 22% with no differences in diagnostic tests between groups (P for superiority = .56). In the PTP ≤ 5% subgroup, the proportion with deferred testing increased from 28% to 52% (P < .001). Overall MACE was 2.4 per 100 person-years. Non-inferiority regarding safety was established, absolute risk difference 0.49% (95% confidence interval -1.96-0.97) (P for non-inferiority = .003).

The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke from any cause, myocardial infarction, major vascular complications, or major bleeding within 30 days after TAVI.A total of 858 patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat population: 431 were assigned to continuation and 427 to interruption of oral anticoagulation. A primary-outcome event occurred in 71 patients (16.5%) in the continuation group and in 63 (14.8%) in the interruption group (risk difference, 1.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.1 to 6.6; P = 0.18 for noninferiority). Thromboembolic events occurred in 38 patients (8.8%) in the continuation group and in 35 (8.2%) in the interruption group (risk difference, 0.6 percentage points; 95% CI, -3.1 to 4.4). Bleeding occurred in 134 patients (31.1%) in the continuation group and in 91 (21.3%) in the interruption group (risk difference, 9.8 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.9 to 15.6).In patients undergoing TAVI with a concomitant indication for oral anticoagulation, periprocedural continuation was not noninferior to interruption of oral anticoagulation during TAVI with respect to the incidence of a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, myocardial infarction, major vascular complications, or major bleeding at 30 days.

Radiofrequency catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation by pulmonary vein isolation with or without left atrial posterior wall isolation: long-term outcomes of the CAPLA trial.,William J et al,2025,European Heart Journal,NA,NA,Persistent atrial fibrillation (AF),PVI + PWI (radiofrequency ablation),PVI alone,338,patients with persistent AF undergoing index CA using radiofrequency,freedom from any documented atrial arrhythmia recurrence at 3 years after ablation,35.5%,42.1%,No significant difference between intervention and control groups.,"No significant difference in AF burden, need for redo CA, rhythm at last clinical follow-up, healthcare utilization metrics, and AF-related quality of life.",The addition of PWI to PVI alone did not improve long-term outcomes in patients with persistent AF undergoing radiofrequency ablation.,"The CAPLA randomized study compared the efficacy of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) alone versus PVI + posterior wall isolation (PWI) in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation (CA). A total of 338 patients were randomized and followed up for a minimum of 3 years. The primary outcome was freedom from any documented atrial arrhythmia recurrence, which occurred in 35.5% of patients in the PVI + PWI group and 42.1% in the PVI alone group. There was no significant difference in AF burden, need for redo CA, rhythm at last clinical follow-up, healthcare utilization metrics, and AF-related quality of life between the two groups. The study concluded that the addition of PWI to PVI did not improve long-term outcomes in patients with persistent AF undergoing radiofrequency ablation.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Posterior wall isolation (PWI) is commonly incorporated into catheter ablation (CA) strategies for persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) in an attempt to improve outcomes. In the CAPLA randomized study, adjunctive PWI did not improve freedom from atrial arrhythmia at 12 months compared with pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) alone. Whether additional PWI reduces arrhythmia recurrence over the longer term remains unknown.In this multi-centre, international, randomized study patients with persistent AF undergoing index CA using radiofrequency were randomized to PVI + PWI vs. PVI alone. Patients underwent regular follow-up including rhythm monitoring for a minimum of 3 years after CA. Atrial fibrillation burden at 3 years after ablation was evaluated with either 28-day continuous ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, twice daily single-lead ECG or from cardiac implanted device. Evaluated endpoints included freedom from any documented atrial arrhythmia recurrence after a single procedure, AF burden, need for redo CA, rhythm at last clinical follow-up, healthcare utilization metrics, and AF-related quality of life.Three hundred thirty-three of 338 (98.5%) patients (mean age 64.3 ± 9.4 years, 23% female) completed 3-year follow-up, with 169 patients randomized to PVI + PWI and 164 patients to PVI alone. At a median of 3.62 years after index ablation, freedom from recurrent atrial arrhythmia occurred in 59 patients (35.5%) randomized to PVI + PWI vs. 68 patients (42.1%) randomized to PVI alone (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.88-1.51, P = .55). Median time to recurrent atrial arrhythmia was 0.53 years (interquartile range 0.34-1.01 years). Redo ablation was performed in 54 patients (32.0%) in the PVI + PWI group vs. 49 patients (29.9%, P = .68) in the PVI alone group. Pulmonary vein reconnection was present in 54.5% (mean number of reconnected PVs 2.2 ± .9) and posterior wall reconnection in 75%. Median AF burden at 3 years was 0% in both groups (interquartile range 0%-0.85% PVI + PWI vs. 0%-1.43% PVI alone, P = .49). Sinus rhythm at final clinical follow-up was present in 85.1% with PVI + PWI vs. 87.1% with PVI alone (P = .60). Mean AF Effect On Quality-Of-Life (AFEQT) score at 3 years after ablation was 88.0 ± 14.8 with PVI + PWI vs. 88.9 ± 15.4 with PVI alone (P = .63).In patients with persistent AF, the addition of PWI to PVI alone at index radiofrequency CA did not significantly improve freedom from atrial arrhythmia recurrence at long-term follow-up. Median AF burden remains low and AF quality of life high at 3 years with either ablation strategy.© The Author(s) 2024.

The effect of the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone on outpatient worsening HF events in patients with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction is unknown.To evaluate the effect of finerenone on outpatient worsening HF events requiring oral diuretic intensification among patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.This is a secondary analysis of the Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure (FINEARTS-HF), a global, multicenter randomized clinical trial. Patients had HF and an ejection fraction of 40% or greater. Data analysis was conducted from September 1 to December 10, 2024.Participants were randomized 1:1 to finerenone or placebo.Primary outcome events (cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, and outpatient urgent HF visit requiring intravenous diuretic therapy) were centrally adjudicated. In this prespecified analysis, outpatient oral diuretic intensification events were defined as initiations of loop or thiazide diuretic or increases in loop diuretic dosage. The risk of all-cause death following each type of worsening HF event (HF hospitalization, urgent HF visit, or outpatient oral diuretic intensification) and the effect of finerenone on outpatient oral diuretic intensification alone or as part of an extended composite outcome with primary outcome events were evaluated.A total of 6001 participants (mean [SD] age, 72.0 [9.6] years; 2732 [46%] female) were enrolled. First worsening HF events included 664 HF hospitalizations, 87 urgent HF visits, and 1250 oral diuretic intensifications. Rates of death were higher following worsening HF: 27.7 (95% CI, 24.3-31.5) per 100 patient-years after HF hospitalization, 13.6 (95% CI, 8.8-21.1) per 100 patient-years after urgent HF visit, and 11.6 (95% CI, 10.2-13.1) per 100 patient-years after outpatient oral diuretic intensification compared with 4.5 (95% CI, 4.2-4.9) per 100 patient-years for patients without worsening HF. Adding outpatient oral diuretic intensification to the primary outcome increased the number of patients experiencing events from 1343 to 2238. Finerenone reduced outpatient oral diuretic intensification alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89 [95% CI, 0.80-0.98]; P = .02) and in an extended composite outcome that further included cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, and urgent HF visit (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.78-0.92]; P < .001).Outpatient worsening HF events requiring oral diuretic intensification were common, associated with poor prognosis, and reduced by finerenone in patients with HF with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04435626.",10.1001/jamacardio.2025.0016,NCT04435626,pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40009358,NA,Y,2025/03/02,,,

Although a retrograde aortic approach is conventional, modern tools enable entry through a transseptal approach that may avoid embolization of debris from the arterial system. We sought to test the hypothesis that a transseptal puncture would mitigate brain injury compared with a retrograde aortic approach.The TRAVERSE trial (Transseptal Versus Retrograde Aortic Ventricular Entry to Reduce Systemic Emboli) was a multicenter randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial. Patients with left ventricular arrhythmias undergoing catheter ablation procedures were randomly assigned to a transseptal puncture approach compared (1:1) with a retrograde aortic approach. The primary outcome was the presence of an acute brain lesion detected by magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary outcomes included clinically manifest complications, procedural efficacy, and 6-month neurocognitive assessments.Among the 62 patients randomly assigned to a retrograde aortic approach with postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging, 28 (45%) exhibited an acute brain lesion compared with 19 of the 69 (28%) of those randomized to a transseptal puncture (P=0.036). No differences in clinically manifest complications or procedural efficacy were observed. More patients in the retrograde aortic arm were categorized as having a high likelihood of cognitive impairment at 6 months (33% compared with 19% of those in the transseptal arm), but substantial loss to follow-up was present.Among patients undergoing left ventricular catheter ablation procedures, a transseptal approach reduced the risk of acute brain lesions by nearly half compared with a retrograde aortic approach without sacrificing safety or efficacy. Given a likely embolic pathogenesis, the brain magnetic resonance imaging findings may reflect a propensity to other organ damage; these findings may extend to other procedures requiring left ventricular entry.URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03946072.",10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.071352,NCT03946072,pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39989365,NA,NA,2025/03/02,,,

The results showed that early initiation of evolocumab provided cardiovascular benefits for older patients, with a more favorable number needed to treat and no significant safety concerns. The study was underpowered for individual components of the composite endpoint.",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Concerns about the efficacy and safety of intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in older patients have led to weaker recommendations in the U.S. guidelines for patients ≥75 years of age compared to younger patients. Data are sparse on long-term benefits of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibition in older patients.This study aims to assess the long-term benefit of evolocumab among patients aged ≥75 years.The FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk) trial randomized 27,564 patients who were 18 to 85 years of age with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to evolocumab vs placebo with 2.2 years of median follow-up. In the open-label extension (FOURIER-OLE), 6,635 participants were transitioned to open-label evolocumab for an additional 5-year median follow-up. The primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) was compared based on the original allocation to evolocumab vs placebo stratified by age (<75 vs ≥75 years). Analyses were underpowered for individual components of the composite endpoint. The annualized incidence rates for adverse events of interest were calculated for the OLE population across age groups during the parent FOURIER trial by randomized treatment arm and during the combined parent and FOURIER-OLE studies for patients originally allocated to evolocumab.Of 27,564 patients, 2,526 (9%) were ≥75 years of age at entry into FOURIER (median age: 77 years [Q1-Q3: 76-79 years]). The median follow-up in FOURIER and FOURIER-OLE was 7.1 years (Q1-Q3: 6.7-7.6 years), with a maximum of 8.7 years. Earlier initiation of evolocumab reduced the rate of the primary endpoint at least as well in older (HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.64-0.97) as in younger patients (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.80-0.92; P interaction = 0.43). The absolute risk reductions were 5.4% (95% CI: -2.0% to 12.8%) in older and 2.3% (95% CI: 0.1%-4.5%) in younger patients, leading to numbers needed to treat of 19 and 44, respectively. The annualized incidence rates of safety events generally appeared similar across treatment arms in both age groups.Early initiation of long-term evolocumab provides older patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease cardiovascular benefits at least as good as those observed in younger patients, with a more favorable number needed to treat in older patients for reducing a composite endpoint and no significant safety concerns. These findings may be helpful in guiding future recommendations.Copyright © 2025 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Participants with a history of stroke were assigned to either use a salt substitute (75% sodium chloride and 25% potassium chloride) or regular salt. After a median follow-up of 61.2 months, the salt substitute group had a significantly lower rate of recurrent stroke (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.95; P = .005) and death (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82-0.96; P = .003) compared to the regular salt group.

Patients who self-reported a hospital diagnosis of stroke were included in this prespecified subgroup analysis. Data were analyzed from November 2023 to August 2024.Participants were assigned to use either a salt substitute, consisting of 75% sodium chloride and 25% potassium chloride by mass, or regular salt.The primary outcome was recurrent stroke.After excluding 5746 persons without a baseline history of stroke, 15 249 patients with stroke (mean [SD] age, 64.1 [8.8] years; 6999 [45.9%] female; 8250 male [54.1%]) were included. Over a median (IQR) follow-up of 61.2 (60.9-61.6) months, the mean difference in systolic blood pressure was -2.05 mm Hg (95% CI, -3.03 to -1.08 mm Hg). A total of 2735 recurrent stroke events (691 fatal and 2044 nonfatal) and 3242 deaths were recorded. Recurrent stroke was significantly lower in the salt substitute vs regular salt group (rate ratio [RR], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.95; P = .005), with larger effects on hemorrhagic stroke (relative reduction, 30%; P = .002). Death rates were also significantly lower (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82-0.96; P = .003), with larger effects on stroke-related deaths (relative reduction 21%; P = .01). No significant difference was observed for hyperkalemia (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.74-1.38; P = .96).Results of this cluster trial demonstrate that salt substitution was safe, along with reduced risks of stroke recurrence and death, which underscores large health gains from scaling up this low-cost intervention among patients with stroke.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02092090.",10.1001/jamacardio.2024.5417,NCT02092090,pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39908026,NA,NA,2025/03/02,,,
